I know DC owns Wildstorm, but is it the part of same Multiverse or outside it?I am gonna need some exposition on Daemon.Great fifth issue of Five extremely well written issues. DC Earth 0 needs an ongoing series like this, like the old 52 series was, where the big stuff and small stuff happens while personal stories go on in each hero's solo series. Sure they have Justice League and Trinity and Suicide Squad and such, but there is space for one overreaching medium that would glue all DC titles together. Say - Sugar and Spike investigating Cadmus while running their Golden Age of Superheroes museum. They would have access to all main and secondary players, non-powered politicians and powered civilians we could ever hope for. And step on toes of some villains along the way with heroes out of mainstream coming to get them out of trouble. MAKE THIS HAPPEN PLEASE!

Its breathtakingly cynical, its filled with strawmen, the writing/art is nowhere near as trailblazing as everyone says it is.There are dozens of earlier series that I though contained greater imagination.  Art wise, compared with artwork by fellow wildstorm artists like Sean Phillips, Travis Charest and Lee Berjeemo, Hitch's art looks bland.I'd advise reading other series from around this time for comparison.  Even at just Wildstorm proper there was a large diversity of titles.   Ellis was just one creator among many.
