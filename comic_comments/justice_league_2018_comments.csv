But most importantly Snyder is keeping his word about not turning this into the Batman and the Justice League show. I like how he focused on J'onn.

That's just a crazy thing that I know was done for the sake of ""epicness"" even though it will likely have zero ramifications moving forward, and that just rubs me the wrong way.Second, it's funny how the Earth was basically just devastated by pieces of it beginning to float towards the moon, and yet once again, it's not going to have any ramifications moving forward. Even assuming the shot of the continents splitting part was an exaggeration, you'd still have every single city completely destroyed.Yeah yeah, comic book logic, but it still comes off as really bad writing to me.",jaywritesgood,15,3,0

And if that doesn't cut it for you, just picture someone using 'magic' to fix everything... again...

But as a reader, so many big things happening and each going ''IT CAN BE THE END OF THE MULTIVERSE'', is just adding to the event fatigue that happens at Marvel too often. I hope DC doesn't follow suit with that.We have this Doom comet, just dealt with Omega Titans, Source Wall is leaking and can end everything in a year, there are Dark Gods 'wished' into existence from the Dark Multiverse...and so on.It is representative of the crazy nature of things after Metal opening a can of worms but again, as readers being overwhelmed, will not help the books.",wowlock,11,1,0

But this issue has us juggling a new League line-up, a complicated plot by Vandal Savage that we're just thrown into, J'onns backstory, the doom comet, and a dark secret that Vandal has. The fact that Luthor assassinates Vandal to gain a base for the new Legion of Doom is probably the simplest, most straightforward element of the plot, really. I think that we really should have held off on the doom-comet and other multiverse stuff until the second issue. Maybe tease it at the end of this one, but make the first issue primarily about showing us this new League's dynamic and letting us get used to the new tone.

Among his many identities throughout his long-lived life, he was worshipped by the Religion of Crime as Cain, the first murderer, who famously slaughtered his brother Abel with a simple rock, brutally beating him to death with strike after strike.

Though his use of Cheetah was not too bad and she retained her intelligence and the Legion of Doom is not just the Joker and Luthor show.

588,Justice-League-2018/Issue-13,"Luthor: ""If I found you here, Batman will be here in thirty minutes. Maybe fifteen."" ... Seriously? Batman is a detective, fighter and engineer while Luthor is a businessman and scientist. Just being smarter by some IQ points does not mean you automatically gain skill equal or better that someone who honed it their whole life.To everyone commenting and tweeting ""#Luthorwasright"" and the like when he was monologuing to the Justice League, I would like to point out to you that he proclaims (wether truthfully or not, who can say) that he considers Joker to be a pinacle of humanity.Luthor makes super secret plans that Joker of all people hears about trough gossip despite everyone evading him like a plague when they have any choice in the matter, yet Justice League is caught completely unaware. No informants, no one cutting a deal with them, no one letting them know just because they would like to live longer and they think Luthor's plan would be the end of them or snitching just because Luthor did not involve them. Justice League is basically a form of law enforcement, yet we see no benefit that would bring. Lack of imagination on writers' part in my opinion.We finally get a competent villain. And while I like the double cross and the reasons for it, Joker is cranked up to eleven with his exact knowledge of what Luthor would do and his scientific and engineering and chemistry knowledge. Joker is great engineer, has some experience with poisons and science itself does not interest him. Even in this issue we are shown that he needs others to fine tune his grandiose plans and make sure his gas would not disipate between being released from balloon to descending on ground. He does not have expertise to design specific gas for each villain and make sure luthor is imune to all of them. He also despises letting others do bigger and badder things than he does, so him leaving Luthor to Freak-Who-Cackles feels really out of character for me. Which is a shame because as I said, I like his reasoning and intention to ruin the master plan just as it would be finishing.Neither villain is willing to face the fact the other is right. Joker always goes for a kill and Luthor always tries to be smarter than everyone and it got old long time ago. I like the fact that they are in character in the stubborn refusal to face the reality is what makes them villains, that Joker's murders are never going to have the effect he wants, Batman will not break and kill him because of it, and there will always be smarter people than Lex Luthor because no one knows everything and it takes time and effort to be expert in any given field.I do not like the art on Cheetah. It does not look all that bad, but... I don't know, looks more like an old lady than a humanoid feline.They kept Ivo's disfigurement. Nice. They are bringing back Brainiac. Bad. Very bad idea.

After discovering the doorknob at his dad's old Legion club, Luthor killed Vandal Savage and attempted to divert the earth's course away from the totality headed out from the Source Wall by breaking up the earth's crust. The JL thwarted that (by blowing up the moon?) and the totality landed. Superman and MM went in to investigate with Batman and Hawkgirl riding along, but they were hijacked by Luthor and Joker. Luthor had earlier put the Legion of Doom together to find the seven hidden energies and unlock the secret of the totality. To Luthor's dismay Hawkgirl reacted to the totality and a pattern emerged on her wings. She, MM and GL travelled to Thanagar Prime to find out more, but discovered that Shayera was holding the Martian Keep hostage in a machine that could create a facade of the Thanagar that had once been. Before she died, the Keep shared with J'onn a secret from his past that had apparently been wiped from his memory - the fact that he'd been abducted by humans as a child, who were researching how to make a human-Martian race for Perpetua (the goddess of the totality, creator of a universe before the current one.) Starman, a hero from the past with some connection to the Source Wall energy, discovered a way to use the remaining Omega Titans and Hawkgirl to repair the Source Wall. That ran into a snag when Brainiac and the Legion of Doom attacked and managed to raise Perpetua's body. But in this issue, they're still looking for a way to raise her mind.",avallon_aurora,5,0,0

1132,Justice-League-2018/Issue-12,"the writer went 4 the joke- which was funny_ but totally out of character for Manta-  Manta would never ask 2 please let him say it-  he would just say it or demand 2 say it_ or squeeze the throat of the person about 2 say it so that he could say it himself, etc.. but, yeah- it was humorousR these  'gods' supposed 2 B  GODS or just cosmic beings or xtra dimensional beings that humans perceive as gods or god-like ???  because it would seem that gods wouldn't b so easy 2 trap- or that they would b able 2 escape, etc... cause when i imagine the joker and lex luthor trying 2 steal the power of GOD - i don't see it being this easy or ending well at all- well, actually not possible at all.    sorta of like face-melty,- like in raiders of the lost ark-    the DC universe really likes cranking out  'gods' - _ did they say (when they were attempting 2 destroy the  'graveyard of the gods'   that there's something cosmic which limits a god's power- what R the  things more powerful than gods ?   _ this story confuses me-  bring in a reality warper and make it right",disqus_5FxmOCqMll,0,0,0

1135,Justice-League-2018/Issue-12,"For me this got off to a really strong and interesting start, (I was thoroughly enjoying it,) supported by some fine artwork and then came, ""Drowned World, another bloody ""epic,"" (far too soon for yet another marketing driven gimmicky crossover and I simply couldn't be bothered chasing through half a dozen other tittles to keep up with the plot ,) and quite suddenly it just seemed to die for me, I found myself turning the pages increasingly lackadaisically and  thinking, ""what the fuck,"" and with diminishing  interest and enthusiasm.I may try and catch up with what's been happening, (or I may not bother,) but it's just become so much bloody work and so complicated keeping abreast of these sales driven tie ins that I can scarcely be bothered, this is a large part of why most mainstream comics have become so tedious and irritating to so many people.",jeremycraigweston,0,0,0

1138,Justice-League-2018/Issue-12,"Another Jason Momoa cover as Aquaman. I like his portrayal in Justice League movie, but he just does not look like comic version and I do not support changing looks of charcters in comic based on live performance. Gal Godot looks fine as Diana, but she is just not tall enough. And Barry Allen is supposed to be blonde, so I hope Grant Gustin or Ezra Miller will not eventually become models for him as they are brunetes. Sorry for the rant, but that is how I feel.... I was told Batman's chair was combat ready. Why the hell would he need LUTHOR's suit? Also, Batman trying to be funny in this situation where the world basically already ended feels out of character. ... He just wins the fight against Joker and two heavy hitters off panel? HOW?""My handiwork turned hopefull beings into relentless villains."" Preah it Didid! ... Oh, wait.The sea gods were surprised Manta did not hold his end of the bargain with them and still they follow his instructions. Which, by the way, why would they even listen to him in the first place?At least this explains why Arion showed up as a bad guy in Blue Beetle.",matejsojka,0,0,0
