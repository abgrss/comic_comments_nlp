0,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-800,"Althought I'm not a big fan of Dan Slott's writing, I think he did an incredible job here and to be honest, this is the BEST issue of ASM so far and currently one of my favorites. Sadly, Flash did save everyone's lives from RG's infectious symbiote splinters and touch but took heavily damage from RG. He wasn't just Peter's school bully or a #1 fan of Spidey, he's a mighty-damn hero! RIP Flash Thompson, you'll never be forgotten.As for Otto, if he thinks about bringing Superior Spider-Man back, I wonder this leads to Spidergeddon.",architectofcomics,57,0,0,0.255,0.6,0.169,0.128,0.702,0.684
1,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-800,"This is definitly a good way for Dan Slott to end his entire Spider-Man run. Its was action packed, emotional, fulfilling and definitly developed everyone. Though I must admit, Doc Oct appearing as a good guy all of a sudden after he vowed revenge in Secret Empire is kinda came on a left field, but hey, what ever allows him to reform officially and possibly rekindle his relationship with Marconi, I'm all for. I just hope that the next TASM writer does things a bit differently and hopefully better than the entirty of Dans run since that guy had a tendincy to sway Peter development as a character, meaning that he would constantly allowed Peter to climb up in his life, only to push him back down, then have him climb up, then push him back down again, which was the most infuriating thing about his run as well as the constant tease about the possibility of Peter learning about his worst mistake ever.

In the ultimate universe green goblin can both transform and has psychokinetic powers. In Issue 791, Normie and Stanley's nanny Emma collected blood samples of both boys, where they both have Harry's goblin blood and Stanley has the blood of the menace as well. In other words, Norman is trying to use their blood to create a more powerful goblin serum which can grant him his abilities and Stanley's unique blood will give him the power of transformation into a different being. Also I am pretty much sure that he must have collected Phil Urich's blood at some point as well. The goblin insanity, a superhuman transformation that resembles a demon, an insane out of control symbiote that grants him abilities that of spider man, hellish powers from the devil himself and a laugh that can make anybody shut their ears. The result of combining all of this will make him a truly powerful ultimate goblin and that is what I am afraid going to happen.

On one hand I like the idea that Spider-Man is actually well-liked now, but the fact that Peter is still treated like the devil for refusing to give HYDRA the company is insane. Likewise his behavior throughout this chapter is apalling - Harry genuinely does his best to help him through everything but Peter keeps ditching him to go play superhero and, you know, avoid responsibility. Remember what that is, Mr. Great Power? At this point I don't mind his friends treating him like shit; he clearly deserves it given the way he acts.Oh and of course Peter shows off how fucking naive he is. Again. When Clayton/Clash nearly causes the building (and the whole block) to blow up because a botched theft of a machine he stays behind to help stop it from killing all of them. And somehow in Spidey's eyes this justifies letting him go and not chasing him...uh, dude, if I pretty much set fire to a building I don't get brownie points for trying to put it out afterwards.I'm glad Harry pretty much told Peter to go fuck himself after this.

415,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-700,"I think Superior Spider-Man was overall pretty underwhelming. It started great, it was a very good idea, but it went south really fast mainly because of the way Otto was written and the way the story escalated to absurd levels really fast. I mean... when the comic ended Spider-Man was kind of an evil genious who had monitored the entirety of New York city, had his own army, his own mechas and an evil lair (and killed people), and no one ever seemed to care or think anything was wrong or different about him (not enough to confront him at least). It got so ridiculously over the top that it didn't work. But that doesn't make this plot twist any less effective or this particular issue any worse.This was a great 700th issue regardless of what happened next.And to everyone who thinks this ""destroyed Peter Parker"" somehow (who reading this comment section are apparently some people) I have this to say; No, it didn't. It didn't destroy anything. Just like Peter wasn't destroyed after OMD, or how he wasn't destroyed after the Ben Reilly affair in the 90's, or that one time he stopped being a radioactive hero and his origin was retold so he's the avatar of some spider-god or some shit like that (remember that? That's probably Spider-Man's biggest retcon and no one seems to go apeshit about it ever!). And it didn't simply because this is a character that has existed for 52 years. This is a character that has been written by more writers that anyone can name, who has been through more changes in his status quo that anybody can mention. And that's the whole point of comics, a writter comes and does whatever he/she wants with the character. Because, aside from the somewhat predefined personality (like you can't make a brooding, dark, edgy Peter Parker or an easy going jokester Batman -unless it doesn't last and the change has an explanation plotwise) there's nothing fixed. What happens to them, the adventures they live, their status quo... are kind of irrelevant. They're just background noise.This, like any other change in Spider-Man's history, made a number of changes, some lasted, some (most in this particular case) didn't. Just like any other time a writer (or the editors at Marvel) tried to do something ""new and original"" with the character. Because that's how comic books work. And sure, as fans we all will have nostalgia towards our favourite period of time of our favourite superhero character(s) but that doesn't mean they have to stay that way (whatever ""that way"" is) forever. If that was true then Peter would still be a teenager going to high school. And nobody really wants that.",disqus_zeEKpNxImG,3,0,0,0.117,0.574,0.12,0.125,0.756,-0.825

It really made you feel something, even if you knew Peter would come back eventually.The character development along this run from Ock was phenomenal, and I can't lie, the people who hated this story most likely hated it simply because they don't like Dan Slott and have a massive bias against him, as well as those who don't like change and always force marvel to bring stuff back to the way they were before.

561,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-793,"I've actually read an interesting article about this.  In the story where Hank slapped Janet, Hank was feeling that he wasn't an important member of the avengers anymore.  He was also in trouble for lashing out against a villain who was going to surrender in a previous story.  So he decided to make a robot to attack the avengers that only he could stop (I know that that is the same plot as Syndrome from the Incredibles movie, but I swear that is what happened).However, when Janet confronted Hank about his dangerous behavior, the writer/editor of the story, Jim Shooter, later explained in an interview that he intended for Hank to accidentally hit Janet as he was gesturing towards her, but the artist of the book, Bob Hall, had misinterpreted what he wanted to do.This whole situation made me feel bad for Hank Pym.  If this whole thing had actually happened the way Jim Shooter had planned, maybe people would have been a lot more forgiving of Hank.  I think that what Shooter was trying to do was tell how serious the battles of mental illness is with many people.  I think that that would have been a really interesting topic to discuss in super hero comics.  Of course, there are other characters, such as Moon Knight and Legion who have mental illnesses as well, but Hank Pym probably wasn't handled in the best way.I'm not trying to say that Hank Pym's actions should be easily forgivable.  But other characters have been forgiven for some crazier stuff, like, I don't know, SCARLET WITCH BASICALLY KILLING (BOTH FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY) THE AVENGERS IN AVENGERS DISSASSEMBLED, AND FORCING MOST MUTANTS ON THE PLANET TO BE RID OF THEIR POWERS IN HOUSE OF M!!!!!!!  And she suffered from mental illnesses as well.  But does she get any crap from anyone (at least to the extent as Hank Pym)?  NO!I feel like there needs to be a lot of retcons to get characters that are considered to be bad (like Cyclops, one of my favorite characters ever), and Hank Pym to be Hero's again.

1323,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-603,"In the past, the Chameleon was depicted as feeling like a faceless nobody himself, hence why he takes other people's identities: to feel like he's a bigger and better man than he is, and so that he won't have to live eternally in the shadow of his half-brother Kraven.Now though, it appears that he takes others' identities because his victims are faceless nobodies, and he thinks that he can make the impression in their lives that they never did, helping them achieve ""true meaning"" in a sick sense since the people he impersonates now are killed beforehand.Interesting change in M.O.Still though, they should have referenced the fake parents thing. Bad continuity or no, it's continuity, and continuity has the intrinsic worth of creating consistency of the narrative and the generation of a fictional universe where events have repercussions.It just hits me though that Chameleon noticed Peter's certificate to teach high-school science classes: a nice reference to the JMS era.Jesus, Chameleon was brutal with the hack screenplay writer.

1478,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-351,Defalco never wrote a good Nova IMO and always made him come off as a huge asshole. I say this as someone who was first introduced to the character in DeFalco's Spider-Girl and also hated him but now loves the character after reading his comics. Nicieza's New Warriors does a better portrayal of the character during this era and while he's still incredibly flawed he also has his redeeming qualities. That said his best stuff is when Annihilation happens because he undergoes a huge character development.,sonpanchan,0,0,0,0.249,0.569,0.198,0.044,0.758,0.952

1495,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-346,"Actually, Spider-Man's shown more courage whenever he's faced any of the Goblins.To me, this boils down to:1) The Goblins tend to be very personal in their tactics and schemes and endanger Peter's loved ones, while Venom generally only endangers Peter himself, aside from occasionally appearing to Peter's loved ones as an indirect means of goading/threatening Peter. Peter has more fighting spirit to defend his friends and family than himself.2) Venom's abilities are tailor-suited to neutralize Spider-Man's own. While the Goblins have variously demonstrated a level of strength and stamina nearly equaling Spidey's, they're not really equipped with the exact set of ""tools"" to negate Spidey's strength and take advantage of his vulnerabilities.",disqus_oJTgn9HBH3,4,0,0,0.221,0.49,0.219,0.033,0.748,0.974
1496,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-346,"That he'd rather defend his friends and family than himself....a fine observation. Some of the best Spidey stories have been when there's more on the line and he realizes by failing the mission, he fails his friends or family, thus pushing himself harder. In other situations when pressed against the wall and looking grim, he constantly reminds himself that it's not just him on the line but his aunt and wife, etc....But yes, all that is why I'd be a little more freaked out facing off against the Goblins. They're not afraid to go to whatever extreme they think will hurt Spider-Man and Peter Parker alike.I think you've got it on the powers-negation. Spidey has never had any kind of formal training or lessons so far as I know, he essentially donned his costume and went on his way, learning to trust in his spider-sense; it's always been there to look out for him and keep him from getting himself killed. With Venom (and other symbiotes) negating the sense, it leaves Spidey at a severe disadvantage, of detection and combat....and perhaps too Spidey's afraid of looking at what the darker version of himself would be like.",colin_o_donoghue,1,0,0,0.025,0.538,0.086,0.121,0.793,-0.87

1607,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-325,"So wait, among the list of reasons not to betray America to the Red Skull, Spider-Man picks patriotism? What about saving the lives that would be lost senselessly in the ensuing international conflict, crushing the Skull for being an unrepentant Nazi war criminal, or retribution for those lives that the Skull's scheme already destroyed? Besides, one could bring up that, if the U.S. were to be economically ruined, that mil would be worth as much as the ashes from the Skull's cigarette holder anyway. There should have been better reasons mentioned than just ""AMERICA FUCK YEA!"" for not taking the bribe.Continuity fun fact, this is the first time that the Red Skull has met Spider-Man (at least in his own titles), but this is the second time that Spidey has met the Skull. In Amazing Spider-Man Annual #5, Spider-Man fought the Communist Red Skull of the 1950's. This is the original and better-known Nazi version, though Spider-Man didn't know there was a difference between the two at this point.Speaking of which, would there be any conflict in Spider-Man's mind about taking a bribe from the monstrosity that Spider-Man believes at this point in time killed his parents?!And why would a high-ranking member of ULTIMATUM, an anarchist group that wants to dissolve national boundaries, ally himself with the Skull, a Nazi who believes in a totalitarian, strongly ethno-nationalistic, Jingoistic state where people are defined as ""cogs in the machine,"" so to speak. ULTIMATUM wants world peace and unity, right? Since when did the Skull ever want anything but despotism and tyranny?And the Watchdogs and the Resistants are supposedly a social conservative terrorist group and a mutant liberationist terrorist group, respectively.

Bit spiteful, or perhaps that's just how she's coping with being married to Spider-Man. Ooh, little blood and gore from Ock. Still kinda bugs me Joy never once suspected or accused Pete of his dual identity. I mean yeah, she accuses him of being immoral on the practice of having a deal with Spider-Man (which does bring up the question if what he does is moral, taking and selling pictures of yourself...then again, look no farther than the Kardashians...oh god. Pete is a Kardashian.)That's kinda vague, Robbie. I agree with you, but that's vague to the point of....""Hey, you suck. Find another line of work."" Tough love, maybe? I thought the direction the conversation was going to go was in vain of ""Hey, you're smart, witty with words, Ned's dead, wanna be a writing reporter, Clark - er - I mean Spider-er-Peter?""Hm...I wonder if Peter wants to maintain his job as a freelance photographer out of a subconscious compulsion to ensure he patrols and keeps the world safe. He uses the Shiny Logic to justify his actions, but I'd be inclined to suspect otherwise. (Shiny Logic, crime means Spider-Man stops bad guys, which leads to pictures, which leads to money which can buy shiny things)I love how all these super baddies lately, Ock, Electro, they defeat Spidey then go ""Oh no, death is too good for you, Imma make you suffer!"" Must be a lot of pent up rage after being beaten so many times. Which leads to the question, why take chances? If he's beaten you so many countless times, why are you so sure this isn't a fluke?

Course....then Firelord might have just decided to nuke the whole city if he didn't find Spider-Man within a certain timeframe.When Kathryn Cushing decimated Jonah's cigar, I'll bet he was picturing that as her contract she was ripping up. Honestly, that's kinda ballsy. Like Marla, I get it, when he first came to her, he needed her to do some dirty work and she indulged him, but refused to put up with any of his smoking habits.

At this point, Peter obviously starts being nervous, knowing what is going to happen once he does that, he wanted to refuse, he wanted to run away even after Aunt May and MJ gave him their support and in the end, he didn't run and faced his fears, not for himself, not for Tony, but for Aunt May and MJ who believed in him. Was it a stupid decision? Maybe. Will it have repercussions? Undoubtedly. But was it bad writing? No, unless everything that tries to change the status quo became bad writing when I looked away. Was Peter acting OOC? Again, knowing the process he went through and it not literally coming out of nowhere, no. It was either that or running away, betraying Tony which he considers a father figure and leaving his own family behind or maybe putting them in more danger as relatives of an outlaw. I can just say that, even if stupid, he made the choice that seemed better at the time and hoping he can handle everything that will come out of it.

Especially since the Punisher used to serve the role Cardiac now does. Give Cardiac his own series like you did with Cloak and Dagger, or use some restraint when putting him in the Spider-books. Jeez, it's almost as bad as the Venom craze that began to kick in around this time.I also don't understand why Stone thinks that Styx is so deserving of a life just because he's responsible for creating Styx. Styx is still evil beyond remorse or redemption! Stone still offers up innocent victims just to sustain the monstrosity he has brought into existence! If Stone wanted to redeem himself for ruining Styx's life in such a callous manner, he should have put Styx out of his misery as soon as he realized how twisted and evil Styx had become. It's the utilitarian solution. But at this point, both have such an unjustifiable body-count as contract killers that BOTH now deserve to be executed anyway.Spider-Man is the master of braindead strawman retorts.

It's just that Kingy got a bit too greedy like the snake he is and bit the government in the back to have whatever of the gold hadn't been dumped yet.As for the government keeping the golden building secret, I disagree with it on the grounds that it violates freedom of the press, denies the public their right to know what happened, and involves flagrant violation of rights in the form of ""debriefing"" so the people at the site ""wouldn't know what they saw."" In response to the utilitarian argument that letting it be public knowledge would cause panic and so this is necessary evil, I make the counter-argument that if laws punishing offenses like assault and manslaughter were more Draconian that they might exercise a greater deterrent effect, therefore allowing for a more libertarian society to exist. When repression of truth and basic human rights is condoned through utilitarianism, it always devolves into authoritarianism and finally totalitarianism.

WOSM filler and the Spider-Man annuals of the past decade or so, with rare exception, were far worse material than this.That crap with the space-locusts was far worse than this.That goofy nonsense with the Tri-Sentinel and Captain Universe was worse and more utterly pointless than this.Anything written by Ann Nocenti is godawful and WAY worse than this.This is cliched and has some groan-worthy dialogue, but at least there's some interesting concepts. The way Peter and Ben are reacting at least makes sense within the context of past and present experiences. At least the focus is on the characters and not some new franchise Marvel desperately wants to promote or a stupid PSA.So far, my conclusion is that the readers hated this at the time because 1) the storylines were long and they had to wait a month to get the next issue of the series, whereas it only takes a button-click for me here and 2) the storylines were all multi-parters taking place across the different titles, requiring flip-flopping among several of them just to keep up with the story in a linear fashion. Also, I guess I understand that the readers might have gotten suckered into buying useless filler, whereas I can just skip something without the animus that comes from wasting time and money and move on if I think it contributes little in the long-term to the plot.",disqus_oJTgn9HBH3,1,0,0,-0.111,0.553,0.048,0.146,0.806,-0.975

As Spider-Man stated in a recent WOSM tale with Venom, he talks about protecting the innocent, but he really lives to kill and slaughter, deluding himself into thinking he's a hero in order to provide himself with the excuses he needs to rationalize his vile actions.And also, why would the Wild Pack's contract say ""dead or alive"" if they were hired to capture Venom for a Daily Bugle exlusive.

3303,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-152,yeah your right but i do think Shocker could beat Vulture in the comics after all shocker is pretty Intelligence to if think you about it yes he not that smart as Vulture but he still smart to create his own weapon Gauntlet glove that could shoot out concentrated vibrational air blast not hating on Vulture or anything but still i did not like that part in the movie plus also vulture create wings that could shoot out like Dagger's not that really powerful if you ask me. A guy with Vibrational air blast is way more powerful then an old bald guy with wings that could fly and use his wings as a dagger. I think Shocker is so underrated though he a cool Spider man Villain though instead of the Vulture to me in my Personal opinion. I do agree with you yes Vulture is way smarter then him but give shocker some credit even know he a thug he still a smart thug that create a weapon gauntlet that even more powerful then vulture wings he even use this gauntlet on Spider man when they first fight in the comic and spider - man did not know what to do so he got hit really hard and the time when Spidey wake up Shocker was long gone i say Shocker is way more intimidate then Vulture is sucks that they kill him off like that in the movie i very disappointed like i say before don't give me wrong i did like the vulture in the movie way more then the comic version but when i saw on imdb when they put shocker in the movie i was so Hyped up to tell you truth I like Shocker way more then Vulture still for some reason i don't know why i  just find him way more interesting sorry about my long comment,disqus_bTs696PytE,2,0,0,0.184,0.629,0.125,0.311,0.564,-0.997

Shocker's supposed to look like a balding 50-something loser that you might think would be in charge of a failing deli or an ice-cream parlor or something.Also, Peter's comment about not even knowing his parents can't be reconciled well with the revelation that his habitual guilt-tripping comes from his parents' death moreso than his uncle's or the auditory hallucinatory flashback showing that Peter was at least old enough to converse with Uncle Ben when his parents died, all from The Child Within. And Michelenie referenced the Funeral Arrangements story that happened right after then in (PP)TSSM, so there's really no excuse. And what does the sequel to the Gang War storyline from '87 running in WOSM at the time of this issue's publication have to do with Aunt May's troubles with the Vulture? That second asterisk for the WOSM reference on page 9 shouldn't be there!Still see that Jameson's got the Wild Pack on retainer ever since that time Doc Ock tried to blow up his building and kidnap his wife. So why didn't he call them up when Carnage broke into his office?! I mean, they would've gotten slaughtered, but it would have been a sensible decision.Don't see the merit in advertising this as a ""sequel"" to Deadly Foes of Spider-Man just because Shocker's in it and mentions something of what happened in that miniseries.",disqus_oJTgn9HBH3,0,0,0,-0.028,0.367,0.005,0.134,0.861,-0.981
