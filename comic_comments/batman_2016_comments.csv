For a character whose selling point is supposed to be that he's human and doesn't have any special powers, he's often been written as invincible, undefeatable, and just overall a Gary Stu. I prefer the stories where his humanity is kept in check. People complain that Superman is too powerful and Batman is more relatable, but Superman seems more vulnerable and human nowadays than Batman does. Even Batman once referred to him as ""the most human of us all."" I often find it hard to relate to Batman, but that's why I like the writing of Scott Snyder and stories like these. They remind us that he is just a man underneath that cowl, even if symbolically, he's much more. Physically, he still has limits and he can be beaten. He even says it himself.

I assume he put his back into place or something, but how the hell did he climb up with a bad back in the first place? And christ why must there ALWAYS be a reference to breaking backs when it involves bane? Yeah we get it, he broke batmans back years ago, its enough already. Bane always goes for a breaking back move which is annoying. Wouldnt batman have already figured how to counter that? And why must he always run into hundreds of enemies just to get beat up and captured? One could say its all part of his plan, but its a high risk and stupid move. What if after being captured they just shoot him instead of all the predictable nonsense super villains do?

This is the attribute of the insecure and conveys the opposite. It seems as though he is frustrated. He should be forcing the Bat into a corner, so that he makes wrong decisions. Instead its the standard ""I'm better than you"" routine normally reserved for villains of lower import it simply isn't Banes style.The fight was lack luster we already know Batman is going to recover because he is giving Bane free punches, when the scene with Catwoman shows up it is all but certain.

And she did not see how the birds were hang up in Batcave.Also she was shown being beaten up and bruised and here she is right as rain.When did Barbara meet Duke? That panel where Batman tells the current lineup they are his strenght makes no sense. When he told them to get out of city it was without Barbara and without Kate. And if he said it before, it would be either with Tim in it or without Duke and Kate. Also Cassandra is missing from that picture.The whole parallels they are drawing between Bane and Batman are making me uncomfortable. I would never call Bruce Wayne sane person. Good person, yes. Capable person, yes. But not sane. However he is functional. His whole notion that he can control himself and everything and everyone around him and thus solve every problem without killing is crazy and it is only because he is driven by that insanity that he succeeded so far. But here they show him to be Batshit crazy mamma's boy and I find that cheep and creepy. He was always portrayed as being intense, but quiet and here he talks to his mother out loud his whole life. Am I only one who finds it out of character? Remember when in Year One story he asked his father for a sign and a bat flew trough a window? He did not speak out loud.Only thing Bane and Batman have in common is that they are both self-made superhuman. But that is where it ends. Batman did it trough diligence, preparation and obsession, Bane trough anger, hopelessness and addiction. Batman thinks people should get a break in life from those who inflict pain on others, Bane thinks all should go trough hell to show they deserve to live.Also Bane is out of character, he was shown to abhor his mother's weakness that she shown by not being able to survive in prison and he wanted to find his own father so he could kill him for leaving him there and escaping himself. All he ever care about was himself and his prowess and his venom.Every Batman villain is something. They were created to reflect the evils faced by people in urban environment. Even Bane. If you did not figure it out, he is addiction.If we find out in next issues that Batman was letting Bane beat the crap out of him I am gonna be pissed. There is no sensible reason to do that. If Batman beats Bane before entering the Asylum it ends there, especially if he has Catwoman to free captives. If he fights and loses he would still buy time for both Alfred and Selina.

With Bane around he would have wanted them locked up in their cells so they would not be harmed in confrontation between Batman and Bane. Not on corridors talking to Bane and possibly getting killed or recruited.I understand Amygdala, he is like a little kid when he is not angry, but since when does Solomon Grundy fear anything? Least of all Bane? He is indestructible, regenerative, already dead and as strong as Superman or Martian Manhunter. What does Bane do with that?Venom controls at back of his head? isn't that what glove is for?Scarecrow being scared of Bane. I may buy it after he resists the gas, but before that Scarecrow was listing fears. In anticipation? I hope so because it sure cannot be fear. His whole obsession with Batman is that he is only thing that still scares him, even fear gas does not work on Crane anymore. Which is why that fear junkie tries to get Batman's attention all the time. Hopefully from now on he will pester Bane and leave Gotham alone for a while.Bruce talks about a SON being hanged in the cave. Singular. Did he somehow annul adoptions of Dick and Jason?Did you expect anything else? Well, yes, I expected the paranoid obsessively prepared Batman to have a better plan than let lunatics loose in asylum hoping to distract Bane. What if Bane is caught as you want and the one guy who did not kill him stays behind and lets himself be locked up in nicer cell. The rest of the armed crazies will not just return to their places they will try to run and wreak havoc on the way until you collect them again. This whole scenario is just as stupid as Batman proclaiming Arkham Asylum to be his fortress in previous issues.Mr. Freeze catches Bane and he just ignores it. If there was a flaw in the ice cover or a steam pipe in room that Bane breaks to increase temperature I would like it infinitely more than ""Bane gets out of ice because plot demands it.""Why would Mad Hatter face off with Bane? He is a coward. At best he would get guards or minor patients without costumed personalities under mind control and have them fight Bane.Bane is upset that his actions have consequences? Why am I not surprised? And his back is broken? How, then, is he walking around right now? Even if he still has control over his legs such injury would leave him unable to fight full out like this.I wish Calendar man did not have a good point about  there being no progress. You have to admit for a guy obsessed with time being in a comic book limbo of time where a character is a university student for 40 years must suck. And then someone reboots the universe and you return to starting line.New Genesis  tech locking a door. Sure I would buy Riddler can open it. If he has time to do it. And the tools. Not in few seconds with bare hands with anger management issues monster breathing down his neck while he does it. Also, what does he mean by War of Jokes and Riddles? I don't think I remember story line with both Joker and Riddler in it in a long time.And once again we have nonexistent parallels between Bane and Bruce showed in our faces.

780,Batman-2016/Issue-19,"""Batman using Inmates to do his fighting? .... Out of character behavior for him......them locked up in their cells.....Not on corridors talking to Bane and possibly getting killed or recruited.""I agree, Batman's strategy here does not make any sense, I wonder if it's the writer's plan to go get us worked up about it. If so the plot so far seems ludicrous and he better have a hell of an answer.If I were to hazard a guess this is just an over-exaggeration  to make Bane seem formidable as an opponent. This is done poorly with ridiculous confrontations with the other villains. An entire issue is thus wasted on cheesy male bravado.Putting that aside some things in this issue if isolated from the plot are interesting character depictions. These are entirely my opinions.""Scarecrow being scared of Bane.""Scarecrow is perpetually scared despite exhibiting very good cognitive responses in the face of crippling fear. This is an interesting quirk to show, because it alludes to the abuse he has gone through. His inability to feel afraid anymore, motivated him to delve deeper and study it. Like most scientists that value their work above all else, he has grown committed to his field of study. When people like Bane or Batman confront the Scarecrow he reacts subconsciously in fear.Batman and Bane have a reputation, they both are intimidating  and they can be equally unpredictable. To a normal person these are enough to warrant the fear of them. Scarecrow is far from normal, he has lost the ability to know that he is scared.""since when does Solomon Grundy fear anything?""I don't see why Grundy can't feel fear. His mental state is not capable of making him piece together his innate superiority over Bane.

His vision however for a better Gotham is noble and ambitious. He has also proven that he is capable of navigating his way around.

It worked, more people are buying Batgirl, Birds of Prey, etc trying to get some clues as to what Selina's answer will be. But in turn, I feel like both stories (the proposal/engagement and Jokes/Riddles) were diminished in the name of a big marketing push.

Riddler talks about murdering the whole bat-family at dinner with Bruce, but the next issue is teaming up with him against the Joker? Deadshot/Deathstroke are the greatest assassins in the DCU, but somehow waste hundreds of rounds and kill dozens of innocents? When Deadshot lost his family to stray bullets and is sworn to never kill a bystander?None of it fits. So the only logical explanation is that King had a couple big things he wanted to do, (Bat/Cat, Jokes/Riddles, fleshing out of Kite Man) and then tried to stitch them altogether into one story. The end result is a lame mash up of things that don't make sense, and disappointment at how his cool ideas were not executed properly.

King making him appear more like a random thug that uses riddles as an excuse to be able to call himself a supervillain; all for the sake of ""cool"" and ""dark"", very different from Zero Year or the last few years of New Earth), a Joker that doesn't laugh, Bruce wanting to marry Selina, using Joker's past in the Killing Joke as an Easter egg and then turning it into an argument how it's just one version of multiple options and he's actually full of shit (this is more of a fact, yes, but the whole ""reference"" was so obvious it felt like one of those fanfictions that has no idea how to write a character so they copy lines and concepts from other official stories to validate themselves), the whole conflict between two villains mixed in with a some sort of No Man's Land, some sort of Injustice-villain-version (even though it makes way more little sense here) and now they're bringing up Joker's fear of being forgotten from the Arkhamverse and Joker's Last Laugh under a form of a joke meant for him to kill that guy because ""dark and edgy"", ripping any sort of meaning from it. That's not creepy, that's just stupid. (What about it is supposed to be humanizing Joker again? What about this entire arc is supposed to humanize anybody at all? I just see cardboard copies of the real characters. It's just being superficial, going from a refference to another. Is this the point? To send a nod to all those things happening in the past for new readers? Are they poking us to go read pre-New52?) At least Kite-Man is more than a joke, even if we could have seen this turn of events from a mile, but still...So comic, please decide what you want to express already. I understand the intent, but oh my god, that execution is unforgivable; I'm still not sure when I'm supposed to laugh and where I'm supposed to be involved. Maybe it makes sense though? I mean, Joker in his whole identity crisis doesn't seem to know how he's supposed to react either 8D Maybe we, as the audience, are supposed to empathize or something. lol But then he'd be the one narrating and not Bruce, so I guess that explanation throws itself out the window.

King still has a thing for making Jason an idiot because...why not ? Same reason as to why he brought back Tiger who accepts all this way too conveniently (even the part where he most probably won't survive). Of course Selina would defeat a guy who defeated ""heroes, villains, armies"" effortlessly (shallowly show she's a good partner for Bruce + cheap humour combo). And the finale, of course let's portray Talia after an orgy to shove Bruce/Selina validation, because buhu she had an orgy, it's so bad ! see ?

1567,Batman-2016/Issue-36,"While I adore to bits the issue as whole, I fear the ""I found you"" from Selina means that Annual story or even just that version of her first time in Batcave is cannon now. My other problem here is that Superman is not that easily recognized as Clark Kent. Clark has different posture, mannerisms, tone of voice, slightly over-sized clothes to hide the muscle tone, even different facial features to a degree, since Superman keeps some facial muscles clenched. It is not just glasses and hairstyle. Yes, each of those things are small and would not fool anyone, but all of them together paint completely different character. So someone like Selina who is not familiar with both Clark and Kal-El should not be able to figure it out so easily. Daily Planet Staffers, however, have no excuse for being dunces.I like the Clark / Bruce dynamic, but I do think that Gordon is his closest friend. They do not reveal Batman's identity by choice, not because lack of trust.I love the art here. Both Selina and Lois look fantastic. And they act like wives that care, instead of wives that nag. And that handshake while men just stand there killed me.Bruce and Clark describing each other is so sweet. Justice League movie had awesome scene where Bruce talks about Superman like this, it is great to see it from both of them.

1569,Batman-2016/Issue-36,No she isnÃ¢ÂÂt. Just because Tom King knows whoÃ¢ÂÂs SupermanÃ¢ÂÂs secret identity is doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean he can just write that in in just one issue like itÃ¢ÂÂs always been that way having the reader compliant just to shrug his shoulders and say okay. It shows poor writing skill. Even Lex didnÃ¢ÂÂt know nor did Lois Lane when Superman married her the first time. Superman had to tell her his secret.Yeah new times and all and the eagerness to make the women more clever finding out secrets to shit that should and always have been hidden by everyone has been so lackluster lately. They simply write it in as they know. Amanda Waller is even worse she walks in to the batcave like she owns the place. Batman was a clueless mess so was Alfred who was startled by Amanda walking up behind him.Do you even remember how Superman and Batman found out their own secret identity. IÃ¢ÂÂll tell you it was in train cabin with lights out chasing the same lead. And they pointed their fingers at each other when they flipped the light switch revealing each otherÃ¢ÂÂs identity. Pure comedy but it made sense how they crossed paths.Now Batman puts a tracer on Superman to find out where he hangs his cape and Superman X-rays bats face. ItÃ¢ÂÂs little too simplistic. But the women somehow makes the discovery based on detective observation. Only makes everyone else in their vicinity an idiot. Lex included.

He has the makings of new supervillain just needs name but not I can see that. Tom King wrote quite the horror story.

To be a villain in gotham, you pretty much have to be a mix of super genius and superhuman.Penguin hires pretty much russian mercenaries, is a master of judo, his umbrella is full of tricks, etc.Scarecrow is a genius chemist, is a master of kung fu which he mixes with ballroom dancing to create a style that fully benefits his long limbs, and yeah the fear gas he creates.Joker is a genius who is also a hard sociopath who can change personalities on a whim to even throw off the smartest people out there, he doesn't feel pain, is a weapons and unarmed fighting expert or master, is heavily unpredictable, has a lot of trick weapons, has underlings who are loyal to him + harley who is superhuman as well, and he is faster than peak human in speed.etc (and those are just weaker batman villains)Maxie Zeus (a c villain) does stuff like drop a ceiling on batman that he has to hold up while he releases a damn lion to come eat at him while he's busy holding up the 1000 pound ceiling (that represents the atlas holding up the sky/uranus)Another c villain (or maybe b) The Mad Hatter is able to hang with batman somewhat in unarmed combat, is particularly quick, and has a hat that can mind control people.People who can't fist fight their way out of a swat team without any stealth involved is overall unable to function as a main villain on gotham unless they are part of a bigger picture like the falcones and maronis (who also have hit hard times) and even they have some pretty stand out combatants in the form of falcones ripped daughter and holiday (albeit he went against his father falcone)In the end, that kid would have to become super intelligent, do borderline batman training, have charisma and money to draw people to him, and also have impressive tech or trickery to do well or at best he might be an underling boss to someone and not like harley or echo.",FearTheSponge,0,0,0,0.171,0.578,0.155,0.121,0.724,0.94

If they had gone with her feeling genuine remorse for killing then ok, but when you make this whole thing with Riddler be the only thing she's sorry about, it discounts all the times when she's killed with her toxins or plants. I would've loved if when Cat or Bat mentioned Riddler she replied with references to Harvest, anyone she's killed with her kiss or harmed, to make it feel like she was remorseful about even being put into situations where she had to kill in general Also I'm still wondering how powerful she is right now. She managed to take over the minds of ~7 million ppl. Not manipulate but full on use them as meat-puppets. That includes aliens and metas with enhanced metabolism. Its almost like the Crisis with Darkseid and the ALE. Where does that rank her mind-control/pheromones? Finally, where in the bloody Green is Alec?!

This, plus the fact that, during King's run, both Batman and Catwoman don't remeber correctly when they first meet, made me thinking: What if this flashbacks are not just tributes and fan-service, but also consequences of Doctor Manhattan actions in the DC universe?Just like happened in ""Superman Reborn"", (where Superman and Lois, after remembered each other, their love and their son, were able to fuse both their pre-crisis and new 52 timeline into a new one), since Batman and Catwoman got even more close, to the point they are getting married, this might be causing their old memories to return as well. However, instead of these memories been from their true past, they are regaining memories from two different eras: The goofy and colorfull tone from the silver age and the dark and serious tone from the modern comics.I think that, whatever is going to happen in the upcoming Booster Gold arc, it will fuse both eras into one single timeline. which could serve as metaphor for DC Rebirth message, that comic books don't need to be always dark and serious. Comic books can also be goofy and colorful. In the case of Batman, even though  most his stories are usually dark and have serious themes (Ex: Long Hallowen, Killing Joke...), they can also be fun and, in certain level, goofy and colorful(Ex: Laughing Fish,  The riddle-less robberies of the riddler, Love Bird, or even some Batman TAS episodes like Joker Millions and Almost got 'Im).",xandodeoliveirafrauches,48,0,0,0.15,0.509,0.123,0.034,0.842,0.984

This isn't like when he tried to save Ted where he tried to permanently change the timeline and even after it was clear how bad things had gotten he tried to save that version of the timeline rather than go back and fix it right away.Here Booster probably thought ""Okay I'll change history for just a few hours and then change it right back.

Batman is a genius, a scientist, he works with what he can understand or prove, and during all his years fighting crimes, he saw two things: 1) the obvious one, he saw what happened in Metals, and us readers, all saw what happened in other realities such as Injustice: the death of the Joker brings chaos. It is his final plan, his killing joke, eather it is a nuke, a twisted Tim Drake or a Jokerized Batman. And since the Joker is unpredictible, even Batman doesn't know what would happen if he finally kills him.2) When Batman appeared in Gotham, he got rid of all the gangsters, Falcone, Maroni...the classics criminals. And what happened? They got replaced by freaks, lunatics, super criminals! Batman knows that there is some kind of tragic balance. That if he steps up and get rid of one criminal, an even bigger threat would appear to set things right. And since the Joker is the opposite of Batman on this balance, if he kills him, something would appear and destroy nearly everything in the good side of the balance in response. It is sad to say but that is why the Joker is not affraid to die, it is because he knows that what Batman is the most scared about is not him, but what would be the Joker's legacy if he kills him.",magicman5010,3,0,0,0.007,0.58,0.051,0.184,0.765,-0.981

I swear to God this is the first time I wanted to throw Joker down a cliff exclusively for how obnoxious he is and that's saying something seeing how Joker is my favourite DC villain. I don't know what impression King has of him, but it's the typical stance of a writer that knows nothing about Joker and tries too hard to make him credible. Joker always has a method behind his madness even when he pretends otherwise. The Joker is a mask, he can be impulsive or gullible, but he's more controlled than he appears even when he was emotional and that didn't change for Prime earth Joker. He isn't unpredictable because he's impulsive, he's unpredictable because he thinks outside any conventional box. Here? He's just random for random's sake. It's not funny and it just makes him appear painfully idiotic. I sort of feel like reading a more unhinged version of Prime earth solo Harley, at least logic means little to her too and if stuff don't work in her delusion then just oops! Sounds familiar?

2103,Batman-2016/Issue-49,"I don't even know what to say anymore. I'm not even angry at this point, I'm depressed.I think King's main issue is that in this comic at least he doesn't really focus on actual good story-telling, he focuses on expressing concepts. And that's fine sometimes, really, but it has been a constant emphasis mostly from The War of Jokes and Riddles and that gets tiring and it is unfortunately also limiting; it only allows for a game between dualities, an eternal dichotomy; even when King tries to make it more complex, it still remains easy. These characters aren't that simple.I can give some credit because this is probably one of those times we saw Joker in his most vulnerable and it's really actually really sad and pitiful, but it's depressing it had to be executed like this and the comic couldn't take its time, allow for some more subtlety, more thought-out dialogue, mostly when understanding Joker often requires to have a good eye for subtlety; he would never narrate his issues to the reader and if he does, then it's totally spontaneous or it has to be a person he feels really close to which till now it has only been Batman and Harley (not just Rebirth, but in general). But I also enjoyed the idea of Joker and Selina having some sort of friendship, because at the end of the day, the Batman villains are sort of in it together, despite the betrayals and the different goals, they just have a long history together, same as the heroes, but again, shame it was executed like this. It also rubbed me the wrong way that Batman had to be knocked out in such a ridiculous fashion only to allow Catwoman to shine by fighting Joker and there is really no good justification as to why Batman didn't try to trip Joker and just immobilize him before he could have the advantage, which adds another layer of uncaring attitude from King, almost as if everything that matters is the concept and how he gets there has little importance. But back to what I enjoyed, I also found it cute that Selina, while she did end up laughing that she won, she held Joker almost with tenderness; it implies that she's not quite done with her villain-side and remains attached to it, which can be another issue for her relationship with Batman, if we think about it. Or at least that's my interpretation. Again, odd though, that King entirely ignored the not so friendly encounter between Joker and Catwoman during Death of the family which, if I may add, entirely contradicts these two's feelings for eachother, with a Selina that feels mostly disgust for Joker and Joker who acted oddly and uncomfortably sexual towards her. I did expect at least a reference.Well, it could have been brilliant and since it wasn't, I'm mourning the waste of potential.

I actually enjoy when Batman's stony facade breaks and he goes overboard, but only when something insane happens like a Robin death.

He's not really a superhero. On top of that, Batman was promised happiness and it was stripped away from him. That's another layer of pain for him.That's why I love the character. He's not better than us. Yes it is pathetic because that's what we're reduced to after break ups.

He wasn't aware he was not himself through the whole ordeal. It happens. According to this issue, we see that he first found EVIDENCE, damning EVIDENCE that pointed him toward Freeze, and it seems that he just sorta lost control DURING the beat down. And AFTER the has CALMED down, he reexamined everything and came to the conclusion that he might have made a mistake, which lead to him TRYING TO FIX it as Bruce Wayne. If you read between the lines, he's trying to get Freeze out while at the same time investigating and catching the real culprit of the framing, which I'm guessing is Bane &amp; co.And here's the thing about framing someone, if it doesn't work at all, it would be a pretty sh*tty job, wouldn't it?

Frankly, I would be more concerned if they did get married without a hitch because then you know something horrible HAS to happen for plot reasons.That being said, given King's Modus Operandi, this will require some significant change/realization from BOTH of their characters, in addition to a fitting rebuttal to the claim ""Happiness will destroy Batman.""

Oh and depression, because of the loss of her intellectual capacity.Cobblepot should be as much as a mess as Dick is.

2596,Batman-2016/Issue-59,"Well, thanks for asking. =)The thing is, I'm not so sure he is that out of character (or maybe Detective Comics is giving me a new perspective about out of character Batman as it can't be worst than that, can it?). He's grieving. He lost his chance at happiness, which already sent him spiraling. Then, he was still hurt, but Dick was there to do what he always does : make things lighter for him, so he doesn't feel crushed by his abandonment issues. But then, Dick was shot right in front his eyes. Now he almost lost Alfred, and there would have been nothing he could have done to prevent it. He keeps losing people, which is the worst thing that could happen to someone who, like I said, as abandonment issues. We saw back when Jason died, and again when Luthor momentarily killed Dick, and again when Damian died and again when Tim died... How unhinged that makes him. He gets more violent, less empathetic, less logical, because he feels guilt over the fact he can't protect the people he loves. The guilt becomes anger, so he starts pushing back everyone else, especially those who try to reason with him. This issue was good, IMO, because I could literally feel his anguish, his rage and his sense of unworthiness. When he hit Gordon, he hit himself. Because Gordon is being as blind as he was. He reminds him of his failure, when he refuses to believe him, the same way he refused to believe Cobblepot at the beginning. It's pretty intense, and, I think, absolutely heartbreaking. Bane is winning. The Bat is breaking.Now it's just my interpretation. I tried to detail my answer as much as I could, but I can understand if you don't share my views. It's very subjective.

I am very curious for an explanation in future issues.My disappointment will be immense if I'm reading too much into this and it was just another crappy generic dialogue line that will ultimately end with Gordon's ""OMG you tricked me?!?!

2773,Batman-2016/Issue-63,"So far some pretty negative comments, and I for one, as John might say, bloody love this issue, arc. Lemme tell you why, so nothing is as it seems. We have this story of young Bruce first, his youth, his struggles, which is pretty standard fare for Batman, but...it's not Bruce, it's Master Bruce, a villain. Then we have a deaf Batman chained up fighting Pyg, trying so hard to get away, but nothing seems to work, it's panic, it's fear, and it's disjointed and glitchy, and then...Pyg is Damian. At this point, it's pretty 'uh, wtf-town, population: us.' But it's this issue that clears it up some more. Bruce (real Bruce) is in a dream, Scarecrow gas is being used to drive him mad. So, let's take recontextualized look at parts one and two. Master Bruce going off killing people and having such a similar background to Regular Bruce is a fear he has. Is he a dark knight detective, protector of the innocent, or is he just one quick fall away from a raving mass murderer?  Then the Pyg one asks the same question, but instead of him, it's his son, who is/was a killer, depending on your definition. It isn't just about him anymore, it also is about his family, something which is lacking from a lot of 'deep dives into Bruce's brain' issues. Knowing this is nightmare stuff, it makes the whole 'being deaf and can't get away' thing make much more sense. Who hasn't had a nightmare like that? Where no matter how much you run, you can't get away? Then this one, is a lot more straight forward, as mentioned above. He fears for Catwoman's death, which again, is pretty standard, but he manifests John in his mind, not Superman or Dick Grayson. John could represent a lot of things, but I like to think of it as failure. It's what John's best at, or at least having pyrrhic victories. Batman yells at him about potential, but he's really talking to himself, because he knows 'Catwoman' is going to 'die' and he can nothing about it. He feels useless.My last point doesn't really tie so much into those previous points, but I think this issue has the penultimate dream, and the next one is when he snaps out of it, summons that second wind determination that we all know and love, and kicks some ass, Batman style. So, I think it's really telling about Bruce's headspace that he dreams of himself happy with Selina (despite the whole 'death' thing) rather than seeing his parents shot for the 16,463,645,1939 time.So, we might be in 'wtf-town' right now, but I think if King can nail the ending, this arc could be a classic.",jamesknot11,78,3,0,0.125,0.445,0.107,0.146,0.747,-0.971

It can seem a bit far-fetched that since he gives everything for his vow, his mission, it made him unable to love but I can get why Bruce would fear that. It's obvious that he has affection for people but it isn't not easy to everyone to know for sure if it's just that or if it is love. And emotionally speaking, Bruce is, well, he's Bruce.At the end of the day it all comes back to the same question, because it means his worst nightmare is that Selina was right to leave him because she was right that he cannot be Batman and be happy. And since he cannot stop to be Batman, that means that he'll have to live a miserable life. He'll have moments of joy, yes, but not happiness. His worst nightmare is that it is impossible for him to ever be truly happy, which is actually pretty human.I also liked the Bane/Thomas stuff.

3033,Batman-2016/Issue-32-2,"Tom King recently made some comments on Comic-con on whether Selina would say 'yes'.King has focused on a singular theme since his run on Batman began alongside the rest of DCâs Rebirth initiative in June of 2016. If Batmanâs character is defined by trauma, what would happen to him if he actually tried to heal himself? At San Diego Comic-Con, he said that in about 100 issues, heâd like to tell a story of Batman trying to find happiness.âI believe you constantly have to work on yourself,â King told me when I sat down with him today at New York Comic Con. âYou constantly have to try to evolve â but you donât evolve ... Youâre always pushing that rock up the hill and itâs always falling down. [But] that doesnât mean you stop pushing the rock. I think thatâs what it is for Batman. Heâs working on his issues, heâs working on who he is, heâs trying to be a better man. But that quest may be quixotic. That may be a foolish journey heâs going on, but he doesnât know it. And heâs willing to give it a try.ââYou add happiness to Batman; youâre creating conflict. Because he as a character is fueled by pain,â King said. âHe turns pain into hope, so what does a machine that turns pain into hope do when itâs fed happiness? When itâs fed joy? You give joy to Superman and heâs like âYay, more joy in my life,â thatâs just another day. You give joy to Batman and itâs like âWhat am I supposed to do with this?ââWhen you point Batman in the direction of the end of conflict, youâre actually pointing to greater conflict. I canât make Batman darker than Frank Miller. I canât make him crazier than Grant Morrison. Thatâs not new territory, youâve seen that before, thatâs boring.âThereâs no conflict in having Batman be sad. Thereâs conflict in having Batman be happy.âThis is not gonna end well.

3034,Batman-2016/Issue-32-2,He'd better not because the mistake of comics is their inability to retain development and use to propel the character forward to a status quo that makes them more refreshing. In this day and age the characters are no longer the same characters who were created to have no development whatsoever. The only one to my knowledge that retains such a character type are the ones over at Archie Comics and that is their greatest strength which keeps them out problems like having to adhere to continuity and reboots and retcons. Which is the mistake being committed over at Marvel as their new status quo is to have a Peter Parker who now hides behind the mask that's not refreshing at all. It makes him an even bigger loser than before. Also what off about what Mr. King's comments is how he describe Batman as a machine when he has been steadily portraying Batman as anything but a machine with him showing himself as vulnerable to things like emotion and even some how believed he would die. And if DC wants a true machine make characters based on Death Note's main characters all the smart guys save for Mello are machines.,theheroesofhope,9,0,0,0.152,0.589,0.137,0.103,0.76,0.689

It showed how new and inexperienced Bruce was, and for once the villains had a reason to interact with one another outside the usual 'let's take out the Bat!!!' scheme. I liked how Riddler's compulsion to solve a mystery is what led to all of this, that was really cool and overall I think everyone came out of this with a lot of good, solid history under their belts and some deep set motivations as well. Bruce is like any other human so it's only natural he'd be faced with that temptation to break the rule, to put down a monster who inflicted such suffering merely to satisfy his own arrogant curiosity. Makes sense. Joker making him who he is? No.More like, Joker reminded him of who he is. Tested him and he passed. Joker can't exist without Batman, we know that by now. If Batman killed, the game would be over. That's the point of the GAME. So it can only continue if he continues to 'stick to his code.' Joker had to push Batman that far -- it's the only way he could hurt Batman and still have the game preserved. This would establish their taunt/testing battles for years to come. It makes sense.
