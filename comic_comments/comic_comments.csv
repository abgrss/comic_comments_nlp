18,Exit-Stage-Left-The-Snagglepuss-Chronicles/Issue-1,"Have to say, I'm impressed with how many wins the Hanna Barbara Beyond line has produced.

19,Exit-Stage-Left-The-Snagglepuss-Chronicles/Issue-1,"I thought that Wacky Raceland was an intriguing and inventive combination of Wacky Racers and Mad Max, its just the abrupt ending that brought it down. Scooby Apocalypse, on the other hand, well that one I STILL do not understand how its still running [maybe that's meant to be ironic, like how the Scooby franchise keeps going? I dunno']I think it would have been better if they merged Scooby Doo with Silent Hill instead of Resident Evil; I mean its perfect; the gang regularly wanders into a haunted area, just like people are drawn to Silent Hill, and there's even a talking dog in both AS WELL as a mystery to solve. Certainly more fun and inventive than mutant Scrappy Doo[Or they could do a Ghosbusters thing. or, heck, even Five Nights at Freddy's!]",trotterprime,3,0,0
20,Exit-Stage-Left-The-Snagglepuss-Chronicles/Issue-1,Scooby Doo will for me always be in part the mysteries. Even as a kid I hated the episodes that tried to discard that premise.,rainspectre,3,0,0
21,Exit-Stage-Left-The-Snagglepuss-Chronicles/Issue-1,"I personally grew to like the alternative take on Scooby Doo. The trick for me was to disassociate it with nostalgia and precious Scooby runs and take it as itâ€™s own independent thing. Kinda weird, I know. But Iâ€™m having fun reading it, so sâ€™all good",dude_ee,3,1,0
22,Exit-Stage-Left-The-Snagglepuss-Chronicles/Issue-1,"I've seen enough crazy reiterations of Scooby-Doo that a post-apocalypse setting wasn't too outrageous. Still, I agree with Rain Spectre, something about it just felt...off. The elements were all there.Personally, I feel that the mere fact that it was a survival post-apocalypse setting is what didn't make it work. Scooby-Soo is first and foremost a mystery. What if the post-apocalypse is already a given environment, and Mystery Incorporated have outfitted themselves to thrive in it? Perhaps they double as mystery solvers as well as monster hunters; maybe some of the mutants in this new world are very territorial, ""haunting"" various towns and communities based on the subconscious drives of their former human lives, or maybe there are malevolent humans who manipulate the mutants for their own gain. Perhaps there is a greater mystery to be solved within the series as to how the apocalypse even happened, which of course would tie back into what the series proper insinuated with Velma's profession, and Scooby being one of the many animal test subjects.",scropio,2,0,0
