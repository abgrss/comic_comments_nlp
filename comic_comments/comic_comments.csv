Purely speculation, but I can see Rick giving a speech or something of the sort to reason with the people, so Mercer can have the chance to address them while the Milton regime is in hiding.

Michonne is another good example of what people end up resorting back ""into"" ... She was for a short time what she *needed* to be to get by until the Commonwealth offered her basically her old life back, and she grabbed onto it because deep down, she's been someone else, she ""changed"" for awhile, but we never saw her ""before"" persona ... We are now seeing it, and from the looks of it, a lot of people don't like this side of Michonne, but this is the REAL Michonne - I'm hoping she makes a choice and picks the persona we've all come to like, but this is the Walking Dead after all, nothing ever really goes how we'd like it too.So, yes, it'd be great if he ""came around"" and matured into a decent human being, but let's all be real, it wont last and he'll end up being a weak character.

320,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-185,"I don't think you get it. Rick and Michonne see the Commonwealth as the closest thing to society prior to the Walkers. They know that this place has its problems and said problems need to be fixed, but you don't throw away the baby with the bathwater. The problems don't need to be violently fixed with a revolution: they can be fixed through peaceful political means such as by leading by example, changing laws, establishing new precedents, and electing new representatives. Sure the Commonwealth is sorta a plutocracy at the moment, but with the right people and the right pushes it can become ideally what America was founded on (a republic for the greater good of the individual).Michonne caught herself and showed great remorse over her waitress-comment. She recognizes she has the potential to become a sociopath-elitist and she needs to keep herself in check better (thankfully her daughter will help her with that). Regarding the Commonwealth officers, they already got informally punished for it hence why the charges were pleaded to be dropped. Trust me, if they had a choice in the matter they probably would have preferred to serve a sentence rather than get the shit kicked out of them to the point they're clinging to their lives in the ICU. Making them serve a sentence after that would almost be like double-jeopardy as well as destabilize the military/police-force by making them feel their government doesn't have their back ever. This would further risk in achieving the Commonwealth's destruction - which is why Michonne defended them out of her principles.

I know a conflict had to brew at some point, but I hope this isn't going to be the big one, but just a false start that gets resolved to show these people are alright, before something bigger rears its head. It's just that after thinking about it for a minute, why would they even need a coup? Mercer has all the military power and security. If he doesn't like how his men are being treated and used, with how people are specialized into jobs in this society, can't they just go on strike? No security til you stop treating us like shit and wasting us on meaningless jobs like babysitting? I doubt it would take long for people to give in.I guess it depends what kind of ""governer"" she is. Like if they've established term-lengths or anything like that. If she's just leading with the intent to lead til she dies, I can see that breeding resentment as it clearly has with Rick and Maggie multiple times. If they put a time limit and actually vote on new leaders periodically, then uprisings would be less likely as they could just wait it out til they can get voted in.In fact, I'm surprised we've only seen groups with singular leaders. I would think something like a leading council, a small group of people leading with equal vote and power that get cycled out periodically. I realize that's what was in the latest walking dead telltale game and it didn't work out for the best...but I feel like it'd work better if psychos and assholes weren't allowed on the council.

They can be enjoyed and appreciated for different, and the same reasons.AMC didn't make a perfect show, but Kirkman didn't write a perfect comic.

This is important because Eugene will probably have to leave his CB radio behind.This all sets up a interesting scenario were once again Eugene is telling the group he is with about a supposed sanctuary that only he knows about. Assuming the survivors escape the Horde its only logical that Eugene will finally admit he has been in communication with someone from Ohio and that this person claims that her location is safe from Walkers.The issue becomes then, Will any of the Survivors, especially Rick who discovered Eugene's deception before, believe Eugene when he tells them about Ohio but has no way to prove it?",briantrachuk,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.148,0.672,0.083,0.038,0.879,0.82

1673,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-158,"I'm having kind of mixed feelings about this arc. Firstly I don't think the whisperer's war-strategy is actually that efficient as the comic wants to portray it. The fact they're not using guns (probably because of lack of guns) means their stabby-stabby ways don't differ that much from a regular zombie, and when you start thinking about it, it's kind of retarded to assume people would let any zombie to a stab distance just because ""it's zombie"". Sure, they were able to wreak havoc but that's not because they are a worthy opponent but apparently because the good guy militia was somewhat incompetent. A whisperer is pretty much just a shit upgrade from your average zombie and the fact the soldiers weren't able to repel them yet is kind of unbelievable.Second complain would be how I'm a bit disappointed in the direction the arc took. I was hoping the tension in the arc would be caused by a more complex set of moral and ethic dilemmas on the topic if it's ""just"" to declare a war on people because they have a differing culture. I really liked the fact for example rape-habits seemed in many occasions be the deal breaker and many people considered they had to re-educate the people to be ""civilized"" again, which even has many historical real world parallels. But apparently we're going at this with the old fashioned kill them all type of a way now, aren't we?

They push the same point over and over. Seem to be about to do it again with Oeanside as well. I think the showrunners just don't understand the characters. Maybe they don't read the comics closely or maybe they just don't take the time to really get to know who these people are. Maybe it's actual hubris where they constantly think they can add to something that's already fantastic. The thing is when they deviate from the source material it rarely even comes out better than the comics. I have trouble reading a lot of the comments on here, even.

Not only that, the story ark with Shane was SOOOOO much better than the comics, oh my goodness I can't even begin with that shit. Negan's introduction...way fucking better than the comics. (Hats off to Jeffery Dean mother fucking Morgan.) and another thing the show got better was Glenn and Maggie. But that is a personal thing for me. Also, Morgans character was way fucking better than the comic, and I think there will be a realistic reason for keeping him alive in the show.. (Morgan might die) :( But overall, I give the show 9/10 and the comic 7/10 Don't get me wrong, I love the comic and I think they did an excellent fucking job with it. But I think the show does a better job at explaining and showing how those things happened. I also know that Kirkman has admitted he regrets doing a lot of shit. I agree with him. Like, one thing that the comic really sucked ass on explaining was the Governor. I mean, the Governor just brought Rick in and for no reason said ""Okay, you don't understand me...choppy fucking choppy on Ricks hand."" I mean wtf I feel like it would have made more sense to take Ricks hand in all out war.. (Maybe it gets shot off or some shit.) Because we have Michonne to remind us of how fucked up he was, I mean come on, he used her katana to do some really fucked up shit.

That was it. Let's be honest with ourselves. I've been binge reading these comics all week and it's only taken me a couple of days to get to this point, and that's all Glenn was. Kirkman slid in the Maggie being pregnant thing at the last second to try to make Glenn's death more tragic.That's why I didn't even care when they killed Abraham in the comic. He was just muscle who screwed Rosita and then Holly. That was all he was. The show, he was fleshed out a little better and I at least thought ""well that sucked"" when they killed him off.There are some things the comic does better, like Woodbury and Andrea.

3948,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-79,"There's a gay couple in the comic, and you know why it's no big deal at all? Because his sexuality isn't the only thing about Aaron that the writer wants you to focus on. In Marvel Comics lately when they replace classic characters with a black/gay/Muslim/etc. character, those characters are 1-dimensional and their race or sexual orientation is the big focus of them that the writers and Marvel wants you to focus on. Like Miles Morales. They piggybacked him off the name and recognition of the Spider-man character, and he easily wins his fight, most of the time with literally one touch. Everyone instantly loves him and the only real conflict is all artificial. The same with Female Thor. Miles' race and Female Thor's gender is all the writers of those books want you to focus on. They don't want to write them to be more than that, they just want to pat themselves on the back for getting rid of ""CIS-white Male"" characters from the books.Aaron is gay, but that's not the defining thing about his character. He's a guy who goes outside the wall, along with his boyfriend, and they risk their lives to look for good people that they can offer sanctuary to. They saved the lives of Rick and his group by bringing them to Alexandria.That is the defining thing about Aaron, the kind of man he is. He's selfless and his main goal is to help good people get to safety. His resolve falters in this issue, but at least he has good reasons for why he thinks maybe they should stop looking for people.If characters are introduced that are gay or black or whatever, the writers of said comic need to stop making that the only thing you are to focus on. Marvel and DC are horrible about that. Aaron and Eric's characters are more than just their orientation, and that is why they are good characters.And is anyone else wishing that Abraham said ""Mother Dick"" in the comic like he did on the show?",averagejoe1987,32.0,1.0,0.0,0.165,0.473,0.14,0.058,0.802,0.981

If he wasn't such a crusted pussy and hadn't taken out half of the group to run away, they could've defended the place and had way less casualties and destruction.And now this? Well, excuse me but after everything, having a safe place after such a long time in the open, everyone in Rick's position would've acted the same. And after being in danger for so long and losing his newborn child and wife, domestic abuse is perfectly understandable to make him go insane. People here are worried about what to cook and if the newly arrived would like it, Pete's beating his wife and child probably because he's a drunk and whatever, you get the point and no one is acting because everyone's a pussy.And you're telling me that he's not a good leader?

4661,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-48,"Judith dying is the reason why I like the comics MUCH better than the show, because, the comics have more nerve than the show, at-least they're not afraid to kill a baby off and Judith was much younger when it died in the comics than she is now in the show. Unless they kill (TV Show) Judith off, the show just reminds me of a lame, toned down version of the comics. The comics were smart to kill Judith off, because, i'm not trying to sound prejudice against the young, nothing against the young in real life, but, babies, toddlers, and, small children (under 5) are an inconvenience for a show like The Walking Dead. Judith burned that bridge with me when she has her massive temper tantrum in the episode ""Inmates"", not only was her over-the-top crying ANNOYING, but, her tantrum put those two young girls in danger by attracting zombies. Judith has to die on The Walking Dead TV series, she serves no purpose, regardless of age for Judith. They could always kill Judith off-screen, even between episodes. They should of killed Judith off in the season 4 mid-season finale ""Too Far Gone"", it would of went great with the comics and it would of been off-screen, because, they showed an empty baby seat with blood on it.",disqus_zZCFoEe8hC,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.009,0.56,0.109,0.222,0.669,-0.989

Sure, Lori stepped out of her marriage but I don't think she is a bad person or a whore. Take a look at the circumstances. Rick was in a coma for who knows how long. The fact that Rick woke up unharmed and made it to Atlanta is a miracle, he should be dead. Then there was a nationwide epidemic. Shane didn't have to but decided to make sure Lori and Carl made it out of their small town in one piece and brought them to Atlanta. I'm sure the whole experience was very traumatic for both of them. I think Lori was in a very stressful situation and sought comfort from a friend. I do not condone it but I certainly wouldn't fault her for it given the crazy circumstances. Why does everyone blame Lori and not Shane?

5248,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-23,"I'm going to be honest, I'm totally with Tyrese in this one. Yes, he is a totall hypocrite, I'll admit to that, and he was wrong to accuse Rick of being a murder when he is just as guilty of the same crime, but Rick was wrong from the beggining.His logic that Tyrese is the reason that Carol tried to kill herself, though on the outside is correct, does not take into account that Carol would have had to have been suverly suffering inorder to do something like that. I mean, she had a daughter for Christ's sake, if she was ready to give her up over losing Tyrese then there had to have been much more going on outside of Tyrese's control.Obviously Tyrese was wrong to cheat on Carol, but if Rick wants to be a 'leader' he can't go around looking for fights, and that is exactly what he did. I think the issue was attempting to show the fragile minds of the group (namely that of Rick and Carol's, and Tyrese to some extent), but the pattern that I am starting to see is Rick becoming less concerned with the good of the group and more concerned with his own version of justice.Rick is like a vigilante, dealing out justice by his own codes in a way he sees fit. With each issue he takes more and more control over the group, and this fight between him and Tyrese was not about Tyrese's afair, but instead about him fighting back against the way Rick has begun to assume all power.

5852,Injustice-2/Issue-72,"There is still the upcoming Annual that was announced, and I think it's supposed to focus on Bruce meeting up with the Kents and is supposed to be ""family"" focused. So if we see Damian go back to jail, that would probably be the best place for it to happen. Maybe he fled Gorilla City in the chaos and went back home, then Bruce just tosses him in jail.We did see Cheetah briefly. She joined forces with Ra's, but I don't think she's done anything outside of stand around and look menacing. I guess she's just sticking around and helping whoever just so she can get a shot at Wonder Woman.Then Black Lightning shouldn't need too much of an explanation. He is the President now, I figured he's probably busy organizing a response to Brainiac's invasion and keeping his daughters safe, and doesn't have the time to get physically involved. Steel, on the other hand, might need more of a reason. Also, what happened to Plastic Man and his son? Last time we saw them they were all melty, but I doubt that killed them. Also I'd guess Starfire is either recovering from her injuries taken in the fight with the Red Lanterns, or she's out trying to find Connor and Cassie.Hopefully they do a retelling of the game's story after the Annual comes out and some of these things are covered in the first issues (like did Grodd throw Scarecrow in the Lazarus Pit, and that's why he's back?). I assume they'll also do another series bridging the gap between IJ2 and IJ3 whenever that comes out. The Black Manta/Aqualad, Jason Todd, Vixen stuff can be done there, since they don't actually appear in the game's story. I'd guess they're just issues dealt with after Brainiac was taken care of.I'd also like Enchantress to get involved in something. She's the only DLC character that hasn't been brought up in this story, and Zatanna has been absent for so long.

7153,Injustice-2/Issue-39,"OK, Batman vs Zod went the way I expected. Batman would have won. I mean, It makes sense and this comic is fondling Batman's neither regions heavily as well.But then... this happened. And again, someone (Ra's) did Batman's dirty work for him. Either throw him into the Zone or kill him, basically the same thing. In my view, killing him is more merciful. Instant death than eternity of suffering, but it's not as if Batman came with the Zone idea first, he just wanted to return him there, so no fault on his end.Then came Amazo. If Ivo said he (it) is not finished yet, how powerful would it have been if finished? And we can assume the taking the head thing is not unplanned. Ra's will have use for it. But then why not take the entire body?It also cracks me up that everyone and their dog is monitoring everything. Batman is, Ra's is... Is Atlantis, Black Adam and Temyscera doing the same?... I mean does everyone have brother eye now, not just Batman?The one thing that still has me scratching my head is Zod himself. He is not a person that has no plan. What was it? Get out, kill a kid then start melting polar ice caps? He should have prioritised Batman for the first kill, but he probably did not know who is the real danger here. Then just get out of there, hide and soak up solar energy. In the end, he is just used for a simple ""remove another character that is not in the game"" BS move without any real addition to the main plot, except that Batman has now seen Amazo.As I said, I don't care much about Tim as a Robin, Dick is the first, Jason is the tragic one and Damian is the blood son, so Tim is the happy one? And I will admit, Damian is my favourite one, but not Injustice Damian, the main DC story one. The Injustice one comes across as a whiny brat, not unlike Kylo Ren (hate him too). That said, I don't care about Tim as Robin, but his death was pointless. Use him as a skin for Robin in the game, not just kill him off for no reason.As for the wildcat thing.

I mean Zoom is a time traveller. Would he not have known about Metropolis getting nuked and the Regime getting formed. Clearly he did not know those things, let alone that he can't exist anymore cause the Regime killed one of his ancestors.My point is this: If we analyse what Zoom said and take into context, does that not mean someones somewhere altered the time line at some point? We don't know where, but it has to be in the 5 years of the Regime being around. Either at the beginning of Metropolis getting nuked or up to Injustice 1 game story.

Certainly Superman went too far for the heroes not to oppose him on principle, but the Regime did bring a lot of benefits to Earth that were lost when it fell. And since the Lords of Order have often been portrayed as caring more about the universe itself than any of the people in the universe that definitely sounds like something they would do.Alternatively, it wasn't fated to happen and the rise of the Regime was supported by the Lords because they wanted a balancing of the scales and Order to succeed in place of Chaos at any cost.Nelson also said he changed fate for the Insurgency too many times and now Nabu won't let him oppose the Lords' agenda anymore.

7466,Injustice-2/Issue-33,"You wanna talk about feds and DA? Ask that question to the main universe. Half of the time the shit they've been through would've been solved if the some of the normals weren't either incompetent, corrupt or at least smart as the smarter villains and heroes of DC to figure out that the villains are getting out through a loophole and stop them. Why no contract on her head by pissed off metropolitans you ask? Isn't this comment about how Harley's getting too much attention? You want at least 5 more issues based around that?I'd agree as much as to shoe-horning Harley is getting annoying. I liked her for sometimes until DC thought we all were gushing over her to get so much based around her these days. But I very much doubt there's that many people you need whining to that are saying she's a hero. She's not scott-free from her mistakes, either. Amanda Waller was there but she got killed. The only reason she's not been punished in-between because the of the Regime taking over, and afterwards the government being formed.At least she's trying to redeem herself from that point. As I said above, the government is fucked up after the Regime, and they can only do enough to keep tabs on the captured Regime members, including Barry who's the only one walking free with only a tracker. And given the trial showed how pissed the government were (also looking pretty happy to finally prosecute the vigilantes by any accusation they can get hands on), if it wasn't for Batman trying to clean Barry's record (go and interpret the opposite if you like, but that's the fact), he'd be in the cells as well.Also cute that you think Joker getting killed is the reason Harley is cured, Arkham games showed a more insane and deranged Harley after Joker died there as well. Even in the main comics, she's shining and more stable and moral without Joker around. going back to your statement, you're also saying she was insane when she committed the crimes of killing millions of people. By that and one of the most common comic laws, isn't she innocent as a sane person? I'd like to disagree, but as I said above, insanity pleas are more realistic reasons and Batman can definitely arrange that whether it's for Harley or anybody else (heck Clayface is part of the Batfamily in the Detective comics) to get hands off her. Which I assume when it lead the authorities to resort to Black ops like the Suicide Squad to get to her.If you wanna interpret this comment as to how this is a perfect description of the generic ""Batman is wrong, Superman is good"" logic set up by Super-tards since the start of the injustice, unfortunately it's not. Let me tell you the only reason you're using the internet so freely with only a few rebukes from opposition like said ""Batman and Quinn groupes"" is cause the Regime doesn't exist in our universe.And in case you're thinking of saying it, inverse that, no, you're not getting killed instantly if you're under Batman's recovery, either (unless you're in Gotham, but even there the major known events to cause collateral damage like Year Zero, War of Jokes and Riddles or Joker's Endgame that happened on Batman's literal first year, year 2/3 and somewhat 14/15 years later) but safe (or unsafe, assuming you're in a war torn failed nation, jk) as much as anywhere else in real life.The entire point of Injustice is to narrow the lines between good and evil. Even the bad guys seem somehow right even if what they're committing is pure evil. And the good guys aren't supposed to be the holy beacons either. Batman, being the most compromised and the most popular in the media had been selected as both the opposer and the flawed person, but he's not the only one who's made mistakes of choosing less peaceful ways, a lot of heroes did, and most of them aren't alive today.

It was maintained for so long not just because Superman and associates were all-powerful, but also because there were benefits to being ruled by a guy who can't be hurt by mortal weapons, including putting an end to crime and war, creating a prison that unlike Arkham and Stryker's could actually hold the people incarcerated there and ending humanity's reliance on fossil fuels by advancing the cause of green energy by decades using Luthor's genius and Kryptonian technology, among other things. And they didn't start out as brutal dictators; they became that way over the course of a long and bitter war as Batman and friends continued to force their hands and they in turn came up with increasingly extreme responses.So you can't say that no rational human would ever believe they were right. For a while they were, and then they became wrong. It's far more nuanced than you make it sound.",aXjGJz7XnG,7.0,4.0,0.0,-0.001,0.534,0.1,0.173,0.727,-0.971

If you were a regular American citizen in the world, you would probably not complain at all in Injuistce Superman's world at all. It has been said that under Injustice Superman's rule, there are no large conflicts in the world (can you even imagine a world without wars?), the planet was more advanced economically and technologically, he singlehandedly stopped an planetary invasion from Apokolips (year 1), made sure no threats comes from outside of earth (year 3), got rid of beings like the gods and trigon that meddles in human affairs (years 3 &amp; 4), and there have been overall global peace. Small crimes still exist but are largely covered by superheroes. There is still the Superman vs Batman conflict, but normal citizens of the world are not harmed or involved at all. Again, Superman's regime is wrong and built on ill-means, but if you're a normal man living a normal life it would not affect you at all, and you would live a safer life.

7592,Injustice-2/Issue-30,"(Sorry in advance for the long ass comment. I got way too carried away XD)The thing is, morally THE END RESULT DOESN'T MATTER.I'll give you a real world example; You could argue that, thanks to companies offshoring we have many things that, otherwise, we probably wouldn't have. Because offshoring makes making products cheaper to the company, so they can produce more, and since it's cheaper to make it's cheaper to sell, so more people will may be able to buy those things, which ultimately will give the company more benefits (so they can expand and investigate better stuff). Also, the fact that the products have a lower quality (and lifespan) now makes it so the companies are force to innovate more, which also helps the end result we end up having. That's why we have such wonderfull phones nowadays, for example.But those things come with many costs. ""Blue collar"" jobs are at their lowest in the western countries thanks to offshoring, we get products that last less and less every year and the countries the companies ""offshore"" to are usually third world countries that don't get too benefit by them moving their production lines there. The main reason why anyone will offshore their company is because there's less bussiness regulations so they are able to pay misseries to their workes while, at the same time, making them work way more hours than any western country will allow them to.But nobody gives a fuck about offshoring being horrible because you can have a expensive phone that allows you to watch YouTube videos while taking a shit. Or cheap new pretty clothes every season. Or whatever the fuck you want. And that's a good thing, isn't it? (and don't get me wrong, I'm part of the problem, I care way less than I should about the world's problems)We (""we"" as in ""humanity"") would have ended up having those very same things but more slowly if offshore wasn't a thing. And the same goes for wars, peace, human rights etc... We will get there. The world is a better place (in term of violence, human rights, poberty rate etc) than it was ever before in human history. And sure, we're not going to accomplish World Peace tomorrow or in 100 years. But I like to think that we will eventually get there.And not only that, when we get there, it will be so much more important because WE did it. Because WE accomplished that. Superman system would have eventually failed because he would have, eventually, died. Wether it was because someone killed him or he died naturally, he would have died, and after that humanity would have gone back to killing each other because the only reason why they weren't doing that is because ""daddy was looking"".It's the same thing that happens with kids. If you teach a kid that ""he shouldn't do that because you will punish him"" he's not going to learn why not to do something, the only thing he's going to learn is ""not to do shit in front of you"". On the other hand, if he understand why doing something is wrong (other than ""because if I do that I'll get punished"") he'll probably won't do it again.",disqus_zeEKpNxImG,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.057,0.451,0.094,0.123,0.783,-0.977

Then again, Bruce is said to be one of the richest and most influential men on Earth. If he, the supposed genius he is, saw the issue of the government failing... well, he too took the law into his own hands, why not this as well. Build a better Asylum. A better prison. Lobby for alternative solutions for the criminally insane... maybe even the death penalty (I know the Batman would never lobby for that, but who knows.)While boring for a chapter, I liked seeing Batman / Bruce getting grilled.

7720,Injustice-2/Issue-28,"There is no better prison though. There can never be. All the best prisons invented in comics fail for a simple reason: they are not bound by laws of physics or logic (just like super powers). They are at the whim of a writer. You could say they invented an adamantium prison inside a black hole placed inside the phantom zone guarded by krypton tech and guarded by an army of daxamites, and still the Joker, or any other criminal, would get out. Because they are the antagonists and they are needed for the story to continue.This could be worked out by introducing new villains and let the old ones rot in jail to be forgotten, but this has never been  thing. Even the Punisher, known for killing every criminal, always lets the known names escape when they confront him. This is why every hero has a gallery of rogues and the forgettable one off villains who vanish after the deed.The whole 'why didn't Batman do X to prevent Z from happening since he is so smart?' is a dumb thing to say. Batman is fictional. Why didn't he do it? Because the writer of the story didn't decide to write it. The writer is not Batman, is not a super smart polymath, hes a normal person who happens to write comics. More importantly the only utopias we see where crime is solved and problems are taken care of are the hipothetical futures that heroes find when they travel in time, where things are neat and ordered.

7836,Injustice-2/Issue-23,"I'd like to clear a few things up here. A) Batman wasn't sloppy in choosing who to bring. In the end, it was all Batgirl's decision. She gave permission to bring Blue Beetle along and in the end, she was the one who told him to stay back and help if there was anything wrong. B) There was something wrong. If you're on a stealth mission and you're told that you're only there to break them out if things go awry, then as soon as something is wrong, you break out the big guns. Beetle is completely justified in his actions. The results were just collateral damage and as long as intent isn't there and there was no knowledge of any sort of underground area where animals would die, I think he can be forgiven. He did his job correctly. C) That species was going to die anyway! If there was literally only one of that species left, then it was going to die alone later on. You could say that they have cells to clone it, but if that's the case, then doesn't that mean that the species can be revived either way? It obviously would need differences in the DNA in order to repopulate, so if their plan hinged on repopulation, then they must have a method to change the DNA and not just clone the same one over and over. D) Does Ra's have a point in his goals? Sure. Were his methods justifiable and intelligent? Not at all! I question what went through his head. ""Hm, how about I kidnap their children and use them as leverage against them to join my side! That's worked so well for me in the past!"" *Insert sarcastic comment about being an idiot here* It's never worked for him before. He always gets his ass kicked when he kidnaps anyone from Batman's life. And given how a majority of his friends are less intelligent and more impulsive, he should know they'd come after him!E) Did Beetle screw up with El Diablo? Maybe? I don't know how, since every other time someone has been blasted with that weapon, it's only ever been concussive on the first shot. And I don't remember Diablo being Captain Adam or Firestorm when it came to the whole explosion thing, so I feel as though the writers may have messed up more than anyone else in this scenario.",therenaissancenerd,56.0,0.0,0.0,-0.005,0.542,0.07,0.094,0.835,-0.816

7901,Injustice-2/Issue-21,"Okay, I'm a big fan of Injustice Harley but even I shake my head at the constant omission of her involvement with Metropolis, like with Steel's line here. She should get way more shit thrown at her by certain characters. I don't say ""they should have thrown her to jail/executed her hurr-durr"", there could be meaningful interactions and character development all around if they just spent a few more panels on this, or even an issue. The dialogue with Ra's a bit earlier was something like that, but that's not really enough. The game proper does a better job at this (Supes holding onto that grudge, some shit talk in intros, a rabid WW actually guts her etc.)There are viable reasons why heroes personally affected by Metropolis might leave her alone (she has more use helping around than being a deadweight in prison, the attack would have taken place even without her help, hero XY rising above their own grief/anger and giving the benefit of the doubt to a criminal, yadda yadda). Batman especially, who could push some justification of his crime fighting methods by pointing at her, maybe trying to counter the guilt he feels about the Joker and others. Meanwhile there should be people still set out for revenge, definitely, not just the Regime folks. Missing stuff like that just leads to inconsistencies and readers getting hate boners. There's great story potential here without disrupting the status quo, and while I love Tom Taylor's take on things, I really don't see why he's not using it.

8034,Injustice-2/Issue-18,"I think you've missed the point.Batman hates taking help from other heroes. Comics history is full of him bitching that he didn't need [insert superhero here]'s help or that Gotham City is ""his turf"". And because he doesn't have the guts to privately contain or just kill the monsters, sociopaths and psychos he ran into on a regular basis his only port of call is to hand them over to the authorities despite a track record that says the authorities just can't handle them.Arkham Asylum is a worthless, piece of crap facility. I know it and so do you. It can't reform its inmates, it can't contain its inmates and if we had a facility that was half as crap at its job in Real Life, we'd have shut it down long ago and replaced it with one that works, which is what Superman ended up doing in the first prequel comic. Batman wouldn't even have to kill them, just find a way to get them locked up somewhere they couldn't escape from every other Tuesday.Batman's choice not to properly deal with the Joker was wrong. You don't believe me, look what he did to Lois Lane and Metropolis. Because he's such a lone wolf who insists on doing things his way, the responsibility for what these animals do when their handlers let go of the leash inevitably falls on him. Animal Man didn't kill the Arkham crazies before now because he's been doing his thing looking out for the Animal Kingdom, that's his jurisdiction. Most others didn't do it because until Metropolis they had all mostly underestimated the ability of supervillains to threaten the world. After Metropolis all their illusions were shattered. And still, you could see it in his eyes that even after the Joker killed his best friend's wife and child (by which I of course mean tricked said best friend into killing them) and contrived it so that would lead to a city of 11 million or so (the comic's words not mine), not to mention that he was going to be the godfather of said child, Batman was still going to try to stop him the useless law-abiding way.All he had to do, really, was admit to himself that his way of doing things wasn't working and somehow adjust it. He didn't, and this is the result.

8065,Injustice-2/Issue-18,"The way I see it is this for all who say Batman is not to blame:1. First off, I agree with all those that say it was the governments fault. In so many US states there is a death penalty. After X amount of tries to 'heal' Joker and failed, they should have done something different. Some are just beyond help.2. In a way it is Batman's fault. He created the Joker when he took the law into his own hands. He broke the law and hunted criminals when that is clearly the job of cops at that time he was not yet deputized by Gordon I think, so he was breaking the law. And he got off it with no punishment for nearly killing someone and creating the Joker. Superman never created Darkside or Lex Luthor. Superman went too far, but Batman did not go far enough, unless it was to stop Supes. He never allied with a demon to stop Joker. He never put Joker into permanent sleep state In the game, Yet he kidnapped and kept his former allies in a off the grid holding facility with no hearings or a lawyer, just like Superman. He was no better than Supes. Damian said: You don't kill but are OK with brain trauma. Why not paralyze the Joker or cause a permanent coma. That is not death. Oh yeah, that would be going too far. As if dressing as a bat and taking the law into your own hands is not going too far.3.  He never consoled Superman, helped him after the attack (or even Dick and Damian for that matter, Batman is an emotional cripple, Superman became just like that, then tried to implement Batman's logic to put fear into people so they don't do stupid things and Bats disagreed with it, even when it is HIS tactic). If Batman had sided with Superman, he could have steered him from becoming the way he did, countering Wonder woman. But he didn't, so Wonder woman told Superman he was right and pushed him further. No one to be his consciousness. And isn't that Batman's thing?4.  Batman knew what the Joker wanted. To push him to do something he never would do. Like killing him. But he never considered as the great detective he was, that the Joker might change tactics? A massive fail on Batman's side. Besides, it is still not known where he got the nuke from.5.  Batman said how many Superman killed. OK, granted the people he burned, Alfred, Billy and GA. But Captain Atom was in a way self defense, since the captain did get the order to kill Superman. And The Martian is the same thing. We don't know if he intended to kill Diana or just incapacitate her, but he was the one to draw first blood, Superman just countered him. As for the Parademons Superman killed. So what? They aren't conscious, they are Darksides mindless killers. Is Batman crying for every Braniac drone he 'killed'?6.  Both made mistakes. Superman: Allying with Sinestro, forcing everyone to fall in line, Accepting the Specters help, killing Billy (really don't like he did that) and many others. Batman: Trusted Constatine, trusted Ares,  did nothing when Zeus tried to take over the world, trusted Hawkman....they both messed up.7.  Batman's logic in my view is faulty when it comes to the Joker. Or in general. Yes he cleaned crime with dirty cops, the mafia and small time thugs. But he created directly or indirectly super villains, and they are much worse than a simple mob boss. GJ Bats. Either Batman is lying to himself or he is as crazy as the people he sends to Arkham. The lying option: He knows Arkham is useless, all the super villains that he sends there never get cured based on the track record. They just bide their time to escape again. And Batman is looking the other way instead of fixing a broken system. The insane option: He thinks that doing the same thing over and over again, this being to capture the bad guy, send him or her to rehabilitation and wait for them to escape will one day yield a different result. So far it hasn't. Only more deaths of innocent people. And what is the textbox definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over again in the hopes of getting a different result.8. I the comics Ganthet said that Krypton destroyed itself and that is why the Lanterns did not help. OK, continuity fail, since in Injustice 2 we clearly see Brainiac destroying Krypton. Is that not an outside threat to which the Guardians have to act upon? Or is Ganthet full of shit?Conclusion: Superman didn't see that he was becoming what he hated. A tyrant. The path to hell is paved with good intentions. But Batman is no better. He is not the solution he hopes to be, just the other side of the problem. I mean Supes killed around a 1000 people and god knows how many Parademons. But the Joker? In the game it was 11 million! And yet, Batman defended Quinn, who is an accomplice to mass murder! How fucked up is that. Yes she reformed, but if Hitler reformed, do you think any sane person would still not want to shoot the guy?Batman is for absolute freedom, Superman for absolute order. Order keeps you safe but limits your freedom, like a dictatorship. So who would want to live a life so restricted, right? No matter how safe you are. On the other hand freedom can never be absolute. Even in democracies we have limitations and the police and judged to enforce those limits. But the question is this: If order keeps you safe but not worth living since you are not free, freedom gives you allot of freedom and choices. And unfortunately, some will abuse those freedoms to commit crime. So how good is freedom, if your too dead to enjoy it because someone robbed you and killed you? The best path is always the one in the middle.In every discussion I see people praise Batman and hate Supes. I say everyone is at fault, just to a different degree. As I said, Superman went too far, Batman not far enough, when it could have made a difference. If Batman believed that this would not change Superman, did he look in the mirror lately? It took 2 bullets to forever change him. Supes lost FAR more than Batman ever did. And Batman was not a friend to help him, when he again could have made a difference.I would still like to know the reason that drove Diana to become like she is in this story. I usually like WW. Bats is the pessimist, Supes the optimist but she is the realist. Here she is just a bitch.Sorry for the long post.",sux_to_be_u,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.016,0.537,0.172,0.194,0.635,-0.994
8066,Injustice-2/Issue-18,"Nice post but I disagree with most of it. Sorry.Superman did create some of his own villains, with over fifty years on scene it is kinda inevitable. Like Livewire and Parasite.Batman could not have joined Superman. That would be condoning his action and he would be in no better position to stop him. He had to choose between having whole Justice League on a slippery slope or split it between them and keep at least some of them without guilt by association like The Flash has to deal with now.As for cleaning dirty cops and corruption and crime... Batman did not succeed in that and he knows it. He cannot succeed on his own he need the system to wake up and be proactive. How to do that now that Gotham became dependent on him as he is on her, that is the question.He can prepare for many things, but the best thing about him is that he is human. He will make mistakes and no man can be prepared for absolutely everything. I would not like him at all if he was a Marry Sue. So I am not about to blame him for not expecting Joker to have Superman kill his family and nuke his city. Their Villains did switch targets before and they always handled them in the end. So they may be blamed for complacency, but... That seems like a cheap shot to me. Not being confident after having their statistics in battle and crime solving would be strange.In closing I am a Batman fan but I enjoy classic Superman. For me the preference comes from ordinary man who decides to do extraordinary thing because he can, and he thinks it might help. I enjoy that more than the near omnipotent being who is at core so good that he is incorruptible and is not faking it. Which is whole premise of Injustice that he did become corrupted by his power once he started using it without any self imposed restriction. And it is same thing that Bruce Wayne himself said many times that he knows it would happen even to him if he ever killed someone.I agree with you about Wonder Woman, I hope there is more to the story than jealous woman sensing her opportunity once her crush's wife died.",matejsojka,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.263,0.551,0.161,0.171,0.667,-0.899
8067,Injustice-2/Issue-18,"Like your way of thinking, but let me poke some holes in it.First off, I don't know that much about Villain histories for the most part, so I apologise for the Superman not making his own bad guys mistake. But do any of his core villains meet that criteria?Yes, Superman had no more self restraint. Because he believed that his restraints before lost him Lois, so he doesn't care anymore, right?As for Batman, I guess, just like with Supes, it depends on the version we are talking about. In Kindom Come, that Supes suffered at the hands of Joker as well and he went into exile, not over the top. On the other hand in the Dark knight trilogy movies, Bruce at first did want to kill Joe Chill, he was just beaten to it.And speaking of Bats. OK, he doesn't kill. Does he take responsibilities for failing people? The families members who lost loved ones he couldn't save cause he breaks the law as a vigilante, but doesn't kill because reasons? Even cops kill when in self defence or to protect the people. I'm not saying he should execute someone in cold blood, but in the heat of the moment when he has to save a hostage or stop a bomber? He will not kill the bad guy to save the innocent? SWAT does that and they are authorised law enforcers. If he doesn't kill because he is not a law enforcer, well he shot himself in the foot there.Why this bothers me is because of this: In many version where a core DC character went bad, in many cases it was Superman. And yet in the Crime syndicate universe it was Batman's opposite, Owl man who was the real threat, at least in the animated movie.As for your ordinary man thing... Batman is Bruce Wayne, he was never ordinary to begin with. Ozymandias was rich, gave it away and got even richer. All I'm saying: Bruce is a great detective, fighter, infiltrator... etc. But is he a good business man or is that Fox at work? Did Bruce earn his wealth or just inherit it?That is the only extraordinary thing about him. He's rich and can buy all the gadgets, have access to the best tech and not worry about his daily job, family or social life. Same as Tony Stark. Take all of that away, Bruce is still a great fighter and detective, but the Joker would not take him seriously by calling him Bruce.As if they handle Batman with kid gloves but decide to shit on any other character if it sells the comic.Anyway, nice chatting with you and exchanging ideas.",sux_to_be_u,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.144,0.554,0.157,0.21,0.633,-0.992

Yes, you can get it through educations and moral telling, not wiiping out the ones who started it.You want an Earth rid of species terminating and environmental disaster?Yes,through speeches and negotiating into the hearts of people.You are not allowed to just kill off all the hunters and pollutions.I guess so.I really don't understand it very thorough.",alan_chao,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18,0.3,0.113,0.092,0.794,-0.34

In original stories Jor-El was saying for years Krypton will be destroyed and no one believed him. The reason ranged from natural event to cosmic catastrophe affecting nearby planets to Kryptonians messing with their core for energy or mineral resources. I liked the ""Kryptonians destroyed their own planet"" version because I liked the warning it gave us, Humans, to wake up to what we are doing to Earth. But one way or another if Brainiac destroyed Krypton, then no spaceships would be ready to send Kal-El and Kara-Zor-El to safety since Krypton had space travel ban and unusually high gravity.I am sorry if this seems off topic, but I really would like to know what led the El family to have working spacecraft at this time.I think it is clear the artist here did not play the game, as the ships are different from each other here.

SheÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂªs both a victim and a culprit.That said, Injustice indeed took a blinded take on Harley, presenting her as a victim, never a culprit. True, sheÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂªs at times victim of abuse, but then she also willingly participates in crimes more than once, and enjoying it. And, paradoxally, that includes the Injustice-verse. Making the blinded ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂvictim HarleyÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂ quite hypocrital in this case, and the fact they keep pushing more and more with that while writing elements which indicate sheÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂªs also a culprit in said-universe is borderly incoherent (a reader ought to analyse the situation and not drink whatever is told to them, how else do you want to judge if something is coherent or well thought out otherwise ?).Somehow, it is kind of understandable though, since this blindness is beginning to be so common you have extreme situations like in HQ 2011 and 2016 where she can murder people and be excused because sheÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂªs a victim, or the murdered people are ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂbadÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂ so itÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂªs okÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥_so somehow she isnÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂªt a murderer. A nonsensical mindset if you ask me but a perfect demonstration of peopleÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂªs inability to take a character as a whole and preferring to reduce them to black or white (which just, in turns, impoverish a charaÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂªs depth).If you are referring to Ground Zero, then you are referring to the part where Joker wanted to kill HarleyÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂªs henchmen ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂ not Harley ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂ to which she interfered and narrated how she didnÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂªt care if he killed her but was refusing that he harmed her people. ItÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂªs the only event I can think of as it is though, yes, Joker is more abusive there than usual, just as an easy way to play the victim card if you ask me.PS : Some henchmen of Joker also are victims. Not all of them are there for ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂpowerÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂ and ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂmoneyÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¥ÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂ.

It could work like this:The movie would be a mix of ""space adventure"" and ""buddy cop film"" and would showcase the beginning of Hal and Sinestro partnership, as the two go on a mission (against the guardians orders) to find out who killed one of the green lanterns. After some investigation they would find out about the red lanterns existence. When they came to the red lanterns planet, Ysmault, Hal and Sinestro would save one of the villains prisioner, Saint Waker, who would reveal their Red Lanterns backstory and their plan to use Starro (he would be a ancient alien conquerer who was ressuected and infected by the power of rage) to destroy the guardians and ""purify"" their universe with the power of rage. After that moment, the trio would be captured by Atrocitus, and Hal would be possesed by one of Starro's star. However, thanks to Ganthet last invention, Saint Walker is choose by the ring of hope, becoming the Blue Lantern, and Hal, using his own will power, breaks fre from Starro's control.

9057,Injustice-2/Issue-59,"Let me show you how the movie should be done and you're very welcome in advance.We open with a human waking up.. he's on a planet that's destroyed... however, he finds that he can breathe and live... and as he looks up... he sees a dead battery. Close in on his eyes and we see a reflection that starts to glow green.We cut back to a spaceship, one of Ferris Space Exploration's premier fleet ships (similar to Cloverfield Paradox); where Abin Sur crashes into the vessel. In the panic, Hal and John Stewart (the military leader) try to lead the team to find out if he's hostile, but he's wounded. As a peace seems to be brokered, BOOM... in comes the Manhunters. As they fight, humans are caught in the crosshairs. However, Abin tries to shield them, resulting in his death. The ring comes to Hal, and in a big green explosion he destroys them but passes out.He wakes back up to the first scene. Suddenly, he's attacked by Thaal Sinestro, the last remaining Lantern. He explains that the Manhunters were hunting them and actually slaughtered most of the galaxy's Lanterns, and the Guardians. It turns out the Manhunters were the Guardians' first decommissioned police squad, re-activated and driven by a new hack. With the genocide of most of the Lanterns, the batter basically lost its life.Sinestro explains that this is why the Oan battery is dead but their rings do somewhat work on sheer willpower. He takes Hal to a refuge camp on Korugar with the remaining Lanterns, including Tomar-Re, Kilowog and his daughter, Soranik.The Manhunters, now controlled by a cloaked master, track them there and attack once more. The Greens are outnumbered but saved by the final 2 remaining Guardians Syed and Ganthet. They reveal they've been scouring the galaxy, taking them to the Source Wall, to find a way to reactivate the Lantern. There, a mystical source (hinted to be Metron) taught them about the full range of the emotional spectrum, and the Blackest Night prophecy, which they interpret to be the Manhunters.They do however find out there's a way to kickstart the batter so the rings can go find new Corps-men; that's by capturing the Ion entity the initial Guardians used to build the battery -- Metron had the location of the entity. Together they all go after Ion and eventually get the battery started again. However at that point, Syed kills Ganthet turns out to be the traitor...He was the one who wanted the Manhunters back into play because he felt they were a stronger Corps. However, his plan would need the battery restarted aka Ion so that's why he played his peers... with this repowered battery, he could now build more Manhunters. In the final battle, Soranik is killed driving Sinestro off the edge. He too gets badly wounded but Hal eventually saves the day by absorbing Ion. Syed is imprisoned, and the battery restarted as a force of good.Rings go out across the galaxy now.Sinestro renounces the Green and goes off... exploring the prophecy and finding the Book of the Black. Here, is where he's inspired to form his Yellow Corps to do protect the galaxy his own way.Syed taunts Hal in prison, telling him he needed a reborn Manhunter army for what's to come... and we glimpse Atrocitus on Ysmault.Finally, we see green rings coming to sector 2814, with one going to John who's rehabbing after the attack on the spaceship which opened the movie.CreditsPost-creds:We see the cloaked figure who corrupted the Manhunters and revamped them. Shockingly, it's not Syed, who's imprisoned, but turns out to be Desaad. This ties back into JL and Steppenwolf's war on them. Desaad corrupted Syed and used the anti-life equation on the Manhunters",disqus_qlYVaWwIcm,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.08,0.416,0.043,0.118,0.839,-0.995

And Ra's is taking the kid gloves off. Will he next time say his minions to not bother taking Batman alive? Not that it will make a difference, just saying. And Ra's speech to Batman, again I don't agree with his methods, but he has a point. And Ra's was good enough to pull a fast one on Batman.

One of the things I love about the Injustice story is the gray aspects; How nobody's absolutely right, heroes being morally less than their counterparts to different degrees including Batman (yet and undeniably he and his allies are the closest thing to the true heroes of this universe, compared to the alternative which is much, much worse) and villains like as Ra's being much more brutal.Are those animals truly living creatures? Or just walking wax figures/robots that were meant to die as part of Ra's gambit to make Batman look bad in front of former heroes like Animal man or Vixen? Thinking like this cause they were melting/frying up too conveniently.Aqualad being villain, or a hero (or someone either coerced through blackmail or mind control here) whichever it is, I'm ok either way. This is Injustice-verse after all. Hope the fanboys take it easy.Btw so he's gonna be Black Manta? If that's the case, it'd be pretty ironic that the original BM share his father's fate and his own son to take the mantle with the same purpose.

9440,Injustice-2/Issue-1,"Listen, Superman may be the bad guy here, and he may have done all those things you mentioned, but that doesn't mean he's wrong. Batman's seeing the worst in him goes all the way back to the first issues of the prequel comic.* The Joker tricks Superman into killing his fucking family and blowing up Metropolis for no reason other than that it was an easy win over Superman, so Superman does what we were all waiting for *somebody* to do and guts the bastard. Batman and a bunch of other people treat this like he murdered a good guy even though none of them have been in the same position and killing the Joker is more of a public service than a crime. * Tired of hearing news reports about wars and disasters that no one else seems able to stop, Superman goes to Bialya, dethroning the local dictator, then makes a public call for the governments of the world to stop fighting each other or risk his intervention. Batman chews him out for scaring people, and has no answer when Superman points out that what he's doing is just Batman's modus operandi on a global scale. * Aquaman sends troops to sea ports around the world and issues an ultimatum to the land-dwellers: stay the hell out of the ocean, OR ELSE. Superman gives Aquaman a taste of his own medicine by lifting Atlantis out of the water and placing it in a desert. The merpeople are all shook up, but the only thing permanently damaged is Aquaman's pride. Batman somehow finds a way to treat this unpleasant but defensible action as a dick move. * Superman gets fed up with the revolving-door prison that is Arkham Asylum and plans to move its inmates to a more secure facility. One would think Bats would be happy to be eased of his burden or at least try to negotiate something with Supes, but no. His exact reasons for opposing Superman are never given, but his overall demeanour is that of a child having his toys taken away - not very flattering. * Confronted with the grim knowledge that an Apokolips invasion plays by different rules than your average supervillain battle, Superman kills Kalibak and his invading army of parademons, putting a stop to the slaughter and saving the world. Civilians all over the world cheer his name to show their thanks, but Batman treats it like he crossed the moral event horizon, even though Superman's actions saved the burgeoning Insurgency as well. It is at least gratifying to see Huntress call him out for being an ungrateful bastard. * Martian Manhunter, having spied on the Justice League while disguised as Hawkgirl for a week, reads Wonder Woman's mind and, seeing how violent and bellicose she's become, decides to kill her. Superman saves Wonder Woman with heat vision, accounting for Manhunter's tumble into the ocean and the SHOCKING REVEAL in the game proper that he was disguised as an Atlantean chronicler and why he was mostly out of the main storyline. Batman, not content with having lied to his allies about their reasons for capturing Hawkgirl, decides to frame this in such a way that it looks like a dick move from Supes, though what exactly he wanted Superman to do instead, I'm sure I don't know.All those things are morally gray, and Superman himself felt pretty bad about a number of them, but each can be defended as a grim but necessary act, one that Batman either didn't or didn't want to see. In fact, an argument can be made that Bats' paranoia is the cause of a lot of the conflict between him and Supes, because he got the chance to join Superman's efforts and declined. If there's a barrier between them, it's one both of them played a part in erecting, and when Supes talks about Batman always seeing the worst in him, I reckon he's talking about all those things as much as everything else.",aXjGJz7XnG,13.0,0.0,0.0,-0.057,0.527,0.122,0.223,0.655,-0.999
9441,Injustice-2/Issue-1,"I guess you have a point. But Batman knew that humanity would rather die on its feet than live on it's knees. Superman cannot be judge, jury, and executioner. Same flaw as capital punishment - you risk killing innocent people. And Batman has ALWAYS tried to ensure that his rogues gallery gets psychiatric help. Honestly, if they'd stay put long enough or leave their doctors alive long enough for a psychiatric evaluation to be completed and sent to the authorities, then several of them probably WOULD get the death penalty, as they are aware of what they did and take pride in it. And you're right, it isn't as though Batman hasn't considered killing the Joker before. Hell, he's TRIED before, after the death of Jason Todd and in Batman: Hush. The first time he was stopped by(ironically) Superman, and by the fact that the Joker had been made the UN ambassador of some middle eastern country. In Hush, Harvey Dent(who had made a deal with Hush: Hush cured him of Two-Face, and Harvey agreed to stay away from the game Hush was playing with Batman) called Commissioner Gordon to the scene in time for Gordon to stop Batman from killing the Joker.

For a character whose selling point is supposed to be that he's human and doesn't have any special powers, he's often been written as invincible, undefeatable, and just overall a Gary Stu. I prefer the stories where his humanity is kept in check. People complain that Superman is too powerful and Batman is more relatable, but Superman seems more vulnerable and human nowadays than Batman does. Even Batman once referred to him as ""the most human of us all."" I often find it hard to relate to Batman, but that's why I like the writing of Scott Snyder and stories like these. They remind us that he is just a man underneath that cowl, even if symbolically, he's much more. Physically, he still has limits and he can be beaten. He even says it himself.

I assume he put his back into place or something, but how the hell did he climb up with a bad back in the first place? And christ why must there ALWAYS be a reference to breaking backs when it involves bane? Yeah we get it, he broke batmans back years ago, its enough already. Bane always goes for a breaking back move which is annoying. Wouldnt batman have already figured how to counter that?

This is the attribute of the insecure and conveys the opposite. It seems as though he is frustrated. He should be forcing the Bat into a corner, so that he makes wrong decisions. Instead its the standard ""I'm better than you"" routine normally reserved for villains of lower import it simply isn't Banes style.The fight was lack luster we already know Batman is going to recover because he is giving Bane free punches, when the scene with Catwoman shows up it is all but certain.

And she did not see how the birds were hang up in Batcave.Also she was shown being beaten up and bruised and here she is right as rain.When did Barbara meet Duke? That panel where Batman tells the current lineup they are his strenght makes no sense. When he told them to get out of city it was without Barbara and without Kate. And if he said it before, it would be either with Tim in it or without Duke and Kate. Also Cassandra is missing from that picture.The whole parallels they are drawing between Bane and Batman are making me uncomfortable. I would never call Bruce Wayne sane person. Good person, yes. Capable person, yes. But not sane. However he is functional. His whole notion that he can control himself and everything and everyone around him and thus solve every problem without killing is crazy and it is only because he is driven by that insanity that he succeeded so far. But here they show him to be Batshit crazy mamma's boy and I find that cheep and creepy. He was always portrayed as being intense, but quiet and here he talks to his mother out loud his whole life. Am I only one who finds it out of character? Remember when in Year One story he asked his father for a sign and a bat flew trough a window? He did not speak out loud.Only thing Bane and Batman have in common is that they are both self-made superhuman. But that is where it ends. Batman did it trough diligence, preparation and obsession, Bane trough anger, hopelessness and addiction. Batman thinks people should get a break in life from those who inflict pain on others, Bane thinks all should go trough hell to show they deserve to live.Also Bane is out of character, he was shown to abhor his mother's weakness that she shown by not being able to survive in prison and he wanted to find his own father so he could kill him for leaving him there and escaping himself. All he ever care about was himself and his prowess and his venom.Every Batman villain is something. They were created to reflect the evils faced by people in urban environment. Even Bane. If you did not figure it out, he is addiction.If we find out in next issues that Batman was letting Bane beat the crap out of him I am gonna be pissed. There is no sensible reason to do that. If Batman beats Bane before entering the Asylum it ends there, especially if he has Catwoman to free captives. If he fights and loses he would still buy time for both Alfred and Selina.

Not on corridors talking to Bane and possibly getting killed or recruited.I understand Amygdala, he is like a little kid when he is not angry, but since when does Solomon Grundy fear anything? Least of all Bane? He is indestructible, regenerative, already dead and as strong as Superman or Martian Manhunter. What does Bane do with that?Venom controls at back of his head? isn't that what glove is for?Scarecrow being scared of Bane. I may buy it after he resists the gas, but before that Scarecrow was listing fears. In anticipation? I hope so because it sure cannot be fear. His whole obsession with Batman is that he is only thing that still scares him, even fear gas does not work on Crane anymore. Which is why that fear junkie tries to get Batman's attention all the time. Hopefully from now on he will pester Bane and leave Gotham alone for a while.Bruce talks about a SON being hanged in the cave. Singular. Did he somehow annul adoptions of Dick and Jason?Did you expect anything else? Well, yes, I expected the paranoid obsessively prepared Batman to have a better plan than let lunatics loose in asylum hoping to distract Bane. What if Bane is caught as you want and the one guy who did not kill him stays behind and lets himself be locked up in nicer cell. The rest of the armed crazies will not just return to their places they will try to run and wreak havoc on the way until you collect them again. This whole scenario is just as stupid as Batman proclaiming Arkham Asylum to be his fortress in previous issues.Mr. Freeze catches Bane and he just ignores it. If there was a flaw in the ice cover or a steam pipe in room that Bane breaks to increase temperature I would like it infinitely more than ""Bane gets out of ice because plot demands it.""Why would Mad Hatter face off with Bane? He is a coward. At best he would get guards or minor patients without costumed personalities under mind control and have them fight Bane.Bane is upset that his actions have consequences? Why am I not surprised? And his back is broken? How, then, is he walking around right now? Even if he still has control over his legs such injury would leave him unable to fight full out like this.I wish Calendar man did not have a good point about  there being no progress. You have to admit for a guy obsessed with time being in a comic book limbo of time where a character is a university student for 40 years must suck.

If so the plot so far seems ludicrous and he better have a hell of an answer.If I were to hazard a guess this is just an over-exaggeration  to make Bane seem formidable as an opponent. This is done poorly with ridiculous confrontations with the other villains. An entire issue is thus wasted on cheesy male bravado.Putting that aside some things in this issue if isolated from the plot are interesting character depictions. These are entirely my opinions.""Scarecrow being scared of Bane.""Scarecrow is perpetually scared despite exhibiting very good cognitive responses in the face of crippling fear. This is an interesting quirk to show, because it alludes to the abuse he has gone through. His inability to feel afraid anymore, motivated him to delve deeper and study it. Like most scientists that value their work above all else, he has grown committed to his field of study. When people like Bane or Batman confront the Scarecrow he reacts subconsciously in fear.Batman and Bane have a reputation, they both are intimidating  and they can be equally unpredictable. To a normal person these are enough to warrant the fear of them. Scarecrow is far from normal, he has lost the ability to know that he is scared.""since when does Solomon Grundy fear anything?""I don't see why Grundy can't feel fear.

It worked, more people are buying Batgirl, Birds of Prey, etc trying to get some clues as to what Selina's answer will be. But in turn, I feel like both stories (the proposal/engagement and Jokes/Riddles) were diminished in the name of a big marketing push.

Riddler talks about murdering the whole bat-family at dinner with Bruce, but the next issue is teaming up with him against the Joker? Deadshot/Deathstroke are the greatest assassins in the DCU, but somehow waste hundreds of rounds and kill dozens of innocents? When Deadshot lost his family to stray bullets and is sworn to never kill a bystander?None of it fits. So the only logical explanation is that King had a couple big things he wanted to do, (Bat/Cat, Jokes/Riddles, fleshing out of Kite Man) and then tried to stitch them altogether into one story. The end result is a lame mash up of things that don't make sense, and disappointment at how his cool ideas were not executed properly.

King making him appear more like a random thug that uses riddles as an excuse to be able to call himself a supervillain; all for the sake of ""cool"" and ""dark"", very different from Zero Year or the last few years of New Earth), a Joker that doesn't laugh, Bruce wanting to marry Selina, using Joker's past in the Killing Joke as an Easter egg and then turning it into an argument how it's just one version of multiple options and he's actually full of shit (this is more of a fact, yes, but the whole ""reference"" was so obvious it felt like one of those fanfictions that has no idea how to write a character so they copy lines and concepts from other official stories to validate themselves), the whole conflict between two villains mixed in with a some sort of No Man's Land, some sort of Injustice-villain-version (even though it makes way more little sense here) and now they're bringing up Joker's fear of being forgotten from the Arkhamverse and Joker's Last Laugh under a form of a joke meant for him to kill that guy because ""dark and edgy"", ripping any sort of meaning from it. That's not creepy, that's just stupid. (What about it is supposed to be humanizing Joker again? What about this entire arc is supposed to humanize anybody at all? I just see cardboard copies of the real characters. It's just being superficial, going from a refference to another. Is this the point? To send a nod to all those things happening in the past for new readers? Are they poking us to go read pre-New52?) At least Kite-Man is more than a joke, even if we could have seen this turn of events from a mile, but still...So comic, please decide what you want to express already. I understand the intent, but oh my god, that execution is unforgivable; I'm still not sure when I'm supposed to laugh and where I'm supposed to be involved. Maybe it makes sense though? I mean, Joker in his whole identity crisis doesn't seem to know how he's supposed to react either 8D Maybe we, as the audience, are supposed to empathize or something. lol But then he'd be the one narrating and not Bruce, so I guess that explanation throws itself out the window.

Same reason as to why he brought back Tiger who accepts all this way too conveniently (even the part where he most probably won't survive). Of course Selina would defeat a guy who defeated ""heroes, villains, armies"" effortlessly (shallowly show she's a good partner for Bruce + cheap humour combo).

11165,Batman-2016/Issue-36,"While I adore to bits the issue as whole, I fear the ""I found you"" from Selina means that Annual story or even just that version of her first time in Batcave is cannon now. My other problem here is that Superman is not that easily recognized as Clark Kent. Clark has different posture, mannerisms, tone of voice, slightly over-sized clothes to hide the muscle tone, even different facial features to a degree, since Superman keeps some facial muscles clenched. It is not just glasses and hairstyle. Yes, each of those things are small and would not fool anyone, but all of them together paint completely different character. So someone like Selina who is not familiar with both Clark and Kal-El should not be able to figure it out so easily. Daily Planet Staffers, however, have no excuse for being dunces.I like the Clark / Bruce dynamic, but I do think that Gordon is his closest friend. They do not reveal Batman's identity by choice, not because lack of trust.I love the art here. Both Selina and Lois look fantastic. And they act like wives that care, instead of wives that nag. And that handshake while men just stand there killed me.Bruce and Clark describing each other is so sweet. Justice League movie had awesome scene where Bruce talks about Superman like this, it is great to see it from both of them.

11442,Batman-2016/Issue-43,"This was some interesting development for Ivy. Also cool how in the end it was Harley that kinda saved them all (with assistance of course).  I love Ivy but this doesn't make sense to me. What stories involving her are even canon at this point? If they had gone with her feeling genuine remorse for killing then ok, but when you make this whole thing with Riddler be the only thing she's sorry about, it discounts all the times when she's killed with her toxins or plants. I would've loved if when Cat or Bat mentioned Riddler she replied with references to Harvest, anyone she's killed with her kiss or harmed, to make it feel like she was remorseful about even being put into situations where she had to kill in general Also I'm still wondering how powerful she is right now. She managed to take over the minds of ~7 million ppl. Not manipulate but full on use them as meat-puppets. That includes aliens and metas with enhanced metabolism. Its almost like the Crisis with Darkseid and the ALE. Where does that rank her mind-control/pheromones? Finally, where in the bloody Green is Alec?! Last I checked Swamp&gt;Ivy, so I'd assume if he's not captured or fighting her then this whole thing got the green light from the Green. Is the Green ok with this?

This, plus the fact that, during King's run, both Batman and Catwoman don't remeber correctly when they first meet, made me thinking: What if this flashbacks are not just tributes and fan-service, but also consequences of Doctor Manhattan actions in the DC universe?Just like happened in ""Superman Reborn"", (where Superman and Lois, after remembered each other, their love and their son, were able to fuse both their pre-crisis and new 52 timeline into a new one), since Batman and Catwoman got even more close, to the point they are getting married, this might be causing their old memories to return as well. However, instead of these memories been from their true past, they are regaining memories from two different eras: The goofy and colorfull tone from the silver age and the dark and serious tone from the modern comics.I think that, whatever is going to happen in the upcoming Booster Gold arc, it will fuse both eras into one single timeline. which could serve as metaphor for DC Rebirth message, that comic books don't need to be always dark and serious. Comic books can also be goofy and colorful. In the case of Batman, even though  most his stories are usually dark and have serious themes (Ex: Long Hallowen, Killing Joke...), they can also be fun and, in certain level, goofy and colorful(Ex: Laughing Fish,  The riddle-less robberies of the riddler, Love Bird, or even some Batman TAS episodes like Joker Millions and Almost got 'Im).",xandodeoliveirafrauches,48.0,0.0,0.0,0.15,0.509,0.123,0.034,0.842,0.984

Batman is a genius, a scientist, he works with what he can understand or prove, and during all his years fighting crimes, he saw two things: 1) the obvious one, he saw what happened in Metals, and us readers, all saw what happened in other realities such as Injustice: the death of the Joker brings chaos. It is his final plan, his killing joke, eather it is a nuke, a twisted Tim Drake or a Jokerized Batman. And since the Joker is unpredictible, even Batman doesn't know what would happen if he finally kills him.2) When Batman appeared in Gotham, he got rid of all the gangsters, Falcone, Maroni...the classics criminals. And what happened? They got replaced by freaks, lunatics, super criminals! Batman knows that there is some kind of tragic balance. That if he steps up and get rid of one criminal, an even bigger threat would appear to set things right. And since the Joker is the opposite of Batman on this balance, if he kills him, something would appear and destroy nearly everything in the good side of the balance in response.

I swear to God this is the first time I wanted to throw Joker down a cliff exclusively for how obnoxious he is and that's saying something seeing how Joker is my favourite DC villain. I don't know what impression King has of him, but it's the typical stance of a writer that knows nothing about Joker and tries too hard to make him credible. Joker always has a method behind his madness even when he pretends otherwise. The Joker is a mask, he can be impulsive or gullible, but he's more controlled than he appears even when he was emotional and that didn't change for Prime earth Joker. He isn't unpredictable because he's impulsive, he's unpredictable because he thinks outside any conventional box. Here? He's just random for random's sake. It's not funny and it just makes him appear painfully idiotic. I sort of feel like reading a more unhinged version of Prime earth solo Harley, at least logic means little to her too and if stuff don't work in her delusion then just oops! Sounds familiar? Just lol. That or this is not my Joker and that time King posted a picture on his Twitter of an old golden age Batman cover with two Jokers on it was actually supposed to mean something. Overall, I just reject this Joker with every fiber of my being. The only moment that made me smile was him accidentally shooting the bride, but then he just goes on and on beating the same goddamn joke to death...and then Batman goes along with him.

11700,Batman-2016/Issue-49,"I don't even know what to say anymore. I'm not even angry at this point, I'm depressed.I think King's main issue is that in this comic at least he doesn't really focus on actual good story-telling, he focuses on expressing concepts. And that's fine sometimes, really, but it has been a constant emphasis mostly from The War of Jokes and Riddles and that gets tiring and it is unfortunately also limiting; it only allows for a game between dualities, an eternal dichotomy; even when King tries to make it more complex, it still remains easy. These characters aren't that simple.I can give some credit because this is probably one of those times we saw Joker in his most vulnerable and it's really actually really sad and pitiful, but it's depressing it had to be executed like this and the comic couldn't take its time, allow for some more subtlety, more thought-out dialogue, mostly when understanding Joker often requires to have a good eye for subtlety; he would never narrate his issues to the reader and if he does, then it's totally spontaneous or it has to be a person he feels really close to which till now it has only been Batman and Harley (not just Rebirth, but in general). But I also enjoyed the idea of Joker and Selina having some sort of friendship, because at the end of the day, the Batman villains are sort of in it together, despite the betrayals and the different goals, they just have a long history together, same as the heroes, but again, shame it was executed like this. It also rubbed me the wrong way that Batman had to be knocked out in such a ridiculous fashion only to allow Catwoman to shine by fighting Joker and there is really no good justification as to why Batman didn't try to trip Joker and just immobilize him before he could have the advantage, which adds another layer of uncaring attitude from King, almost as if everything that matters is the concept and how he gets there has little importance. But back to what I enjoyed, I also found it cute that Selina, while she did end up laughing that she won, she held Joker almost with tenderness; it implies that she's not quite done with her villain-side and remains attached to it, which can be another issue for her relationship with Batman, if we think about it. Or at least that's my interpretation. Again, odd though, that King entirely ignored the not so friendly encounter between Joker and Catwoman during Death of the family which, if I may add, entirely contradicts these two's feelings for eachother, with a Selina that feels mostly disgust for Joker and Joker who acted oddly and uncomfortably sexual towards her. I did expect at least a reference.Well, it could have been brilliant and since it wasn't, I'm mourning the waste of potential.

The cover is as much wedding as we will ever get. Maybe they eventually do get married at the end since Tom King said there will be 100 issues and it will focus on Batman and Catwomans relationship. I'm hoping this is just a minor setback because even if they did get married this issue it still wouldn't feel as climatic as it should imo. I mean where is Supes, Nightwing, etc all them? I mean they know Batman was getting married. What about all those preludes to the wedding? I just don't get it.

I actually enjoy when Batman's stony facade breaks and he goes overboard, but only when something insane happens like a Robin death.

You wonder why Batman, a guy who's gotten through the pain of having dead family members, would be so hurt over a break up? Because he's human. It hurts. He is a crazy guy in a bat costume. He's not really a superhero. On top of that, Batman was promised happiness and it was stripped away from him. That's another layer of pain for him.That's why I love the character. He's not better than us. Yes it is pathetic because that's what we're reduced to after break ups.

According to this issue, we see that he first found EVIDENCE, damning EVIDENCE that pointed him toward Freeze, and it seems that he just sorta lost control DURING the beat down. And AFTER the has CALMED down, he reexamined everything and came to the conclusion that he might have made a mistake, which lead to him TRYING TO FIX it as Bruce Wayne. If you read between the lines, he's trying to get Freeze out while at the same time investigating and catching the real culprit of the framing, which I'm guessing is Bane &amp; co.And here's the thing about framing someone, if it doesn't work at all, it would be a pretty sh*tty job, wouldn't it?

Frankly, I would be more concerned if they did get married without a hitch because then you know something horrible HAS to happen for plot reasons.That being said, given King's Modus Operandi, this will require some significant change/realization from BOTH of their characters, in addition to a fitting rebuttal to the claim ""Happiness will destroy Batman.""

12191,Batman-2016/Issue-59,"Well, thanks for asking. =)The thing is, I'm not so sure he is that out of character (or maybe Detective Comics is giving me a new perspective about out of character Batman as it can't be worst than that, can it?). He's grieving. He lost his chance at happiness, which already sent him spiraling. Then, he was still hurt, but Dick was there to do what he always does : make things lighter for him, so he doesn't feel crushed by his abandonment issues. But then, Dick was shot right in front his eyes. Now he almost lost Alfred, and there would have been nothing he could have done to prevent it. He keeps losing people, which is the worst thing that could happen to someone who, like I said, as abandonment issues. We saw back when Jason died, and again when Luthor momentarily killed Dick, and again when Damian died and again when Tim died... How unhinged that makes him. He gets more violent, less empathetic, less logical, because he feels guilt over the fact he can't protect the people he loves. The guilt becomes anger, so he starts pushing back everyone else, especially those who try to reason with him. This issue was good, IMO, because I could literally feel his anguish, his rage and his sense of unworthiness. When he hit Gordon, he hit himself. Because Gordon is being as blind as he was. He reminds him of his failure, when he refuses to believe him, the same way he refused to believe Cobblepot at the beginning. It's pretty intense, and, I think, absolutely heartbreaking. Bane is winning. The Bat is breaking.Now it's just my interpretation. I tried to detail my answer as much as I could, but I can understand if you don't share my views. It's very subjective.

At this point, I'm just bored.",disqus_QdIPH4EBO2,2.0,0.0,0.0,-0.075,0.609,0.117,0.074,0.808,0.507

12366,Batman-2016/Issue-63,"So far some pretty negative comments, and I for one, as John might say, bloody love this issue, arc. Lemme tell you why, so nothing is as it seems. We have this story of young Bruce first, his youth, his struggles, which is pretty standard fare for Batman, but...it's not Bruce, it's Master Bruce, a villain. Then we have a deaf Batman chained up fighting Pyg, trying so hard to get away, but nothing seems to work, it's panic, it's fear, and it's disjointed and glitchy, and then...Pyg is Damian. At this point, it's pretty 'uh, wtf-town, population: us.' But it's this issue that clears it up some more. Bruce (real Bruce) is in a dream, Scarecrow gas is being used to drive him mad. So, let's take recontextualized look at parts one and two. Master Bruce going off killing people and having such a similar background to Regular Bruce is a fear he has. Is he a dark knight detective, protector of the innocent, or is he just one quick fall away from a raving mass murderer?  Then the Pyg one asks the same question, but instead of him, it's his son, who is/was a killer, depending on your definition. It isn't just about him anymore, it also is about his family, something which is lacking from a lot of 'deep dives into Bruce's brain' issues. Knowing this is nightmare stuff, it makes the whole 'being deaf and can't get away' thing make much more sense. Who hasn't had a nightmare like that? Where no matter how much you run, you can't get away? Then this one, is a lot more straight forward, as mentioned above. He fears for Catwoman's death, which again, is pretty standard, but he manifests John in his mind, not Superman or Dick Grayson. John could represent a lot of things, but I like to think of it as failure. It's what John's best at, or at least having pyrrhic victories. Batman yells at him about potential, but he's really talking to himself, because he knows 'Catwoman' is going to 'die' and he can nothing about it. He feels useless.My last point doesn't really tie so much into those previous points, but I think this issue has the penultimate dream, and the next one is when he snaps out of it, summons that second wind determination that we all know and love, and kicks some ass, Batman style. So, I think it's really telling about Bruce's headspace that he dreams of himself happy with Selina (despite the whole 'death' thing) rather than seeing his parents shot for the 16,463,645,1939 time.So, we might be in 'wtf-town' right now, but I think if King can nail the ending, this arc could be a classic.",jamesknot11,78.0,3.0,0.0,0.125,0.445,0.107,0.146,0.747,-0.971

It can seem a bit far-fetched that since he gives everything for his vow, his mission, it made him unable to love but I can get why Bruce would fear that. It's obvious that he has affection for people but it isn't not easy to everyone to know for sure if it's just that or if it is love. And emotionally speaking, Bruce is, well, he's Bruce.At the end of the day it all comes back to the same question, because it means his worst nightmare is that Selina was right to leave him because she was right that he cannot be Batman and be happy. And since he cannot stop to be Batman, that means that he'll have to live a miserable life. He'll have moments of joy, yes, but not happiness. His worst nightmare is that it is impossible for him to ever be truly happy, which is actually pretty human.I also liked the Bane/Thomas stuff. The whole ""I'm messing up my sons's life so he stops being Batman and can have a happier life"", that I had guessed, but it's surprising yet interesting how Thomas is having fun with Bane and that he has the last word in this issue.Still, I have one question: why is Bane always fighting NAKED?",pierrickdrahcoh,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.091,0.601,0.196,0.134,0.67,0.971

12627,Batman-2016/Issue-32-2,He'd better not because the mistake of comics is their inability to retain development and use to propel the character forward to a status quo that makes them more refreshing. In this day and age the characters are no longer the same characters who were created to have no development whatsoever. The only one to my knowledge that retains such a character type are the ones over at Archie Comics and that is their greatest strength which keeps them out problems like having to adhere to continuity and reboots and retcons. Which is the mistake being committed over at Marvel as their new status quo is to have a Peter Parker who now hides behind the mask that's not refreshing at all. It makes him an even bigger loser than before. Also what off about what Mr. King's comments is how he describe Batman as a machine when he has been steadily portraying Batman as anything but a machine with him showing himself as vulnerable to things like emotion and even some how believed he would die. And if DC wants a true machine make characters based on Death Note's main characters all the smart guys save for Mello are machines.,theheroesofhope,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.152,0.589,0.137,0.103,0.76,0.689

It showed how new and inexperienced Bruce was, and for once the villains had a reason to interact with one another outside the usual 'let's take out the Bat!!!' scheme. I liked how Riddler's compulsion to solve a mystery is what led to all of this, that was really cool and overall I think everyone came out of this with a lot of good, solid history under their belts and some deep set motivations as well. Bruce is like any other human so it's only natural he'd be faced with that temptation to break the rule, to put down a monster who inflicted such suffering merely to satisfy his own arrogant curiosity. Makes sense. Joker making him who he is? No.More like, Joker reminded him of who he is. Tested him and he passed. Joker can't exist without Batman, we know that by now. If Batman killed, the game would be over. That's the point of the GAME. So it can only continue if he continues to 'stick to his code.' Joker had to push Batman that far -- it's the only way he could hurt Batman and still have the game preserved. This would establish their taunt/testing battles for years to come. It makes sense.

Still, I agree with Rain Spectre, something about it just felt...off. The elements were all there.Personally, I feel that the mere fact that it was a survival post-apocalypse setting is what didn't make it work. Scooby-Soo is first and foremost a mystery. What if the post-apocalypse is already a given environment, and Mystery Incorporated have outfitted themselves to thrive in it? Perhaps they double as mystery solvers as well as monster hunters; maybe some of the mutants in this new world are very territorial, ""haunting"" various towns and communities based on the subconscious drives of their former human lives, or maybe there are malevolent humans who manipulate the mutants for their own gain. Perhaps there is a greater mystery to be solved within the series as to how the apocalypse even happened, which of course would tie back into what the series proper insinuated with Velma's profession, and Scooby being one of the many animal test subjects.",scropio,2.0,0.0,0.0,-0.04,0.458,0.086,0.014,0.9,0.893

13439,Justice-League-2018/Issue-13,"Luthor: ""If I found you here, Batman will be here in thirty minutes. Maybe fifteen."" ... Seriously? Batman is a detective, fighter and engineer while Luthor is a businessman and scientist. Just being smarter by some IQ points does not mean you automatically gain skill equal or better that someone who honed it their whole life.To everyone commenting and tweeting ""#Luthorwasright"" and the like when he was monologuing to the Justice League, I would like to point out to you that he proclaims (wether truthfully or not, who can say) that he considers Joker to be a pinacle of humanity.Luthor makes super secret plans that Joker of all people hears about trough gossip despite everyone evading him like a plague when they have any choice in the matter, yet Justice League is caught completely unaware. No informants, no one cutting a deal with them, no one letting them know just because they would like to live longer and they think Luthor's plan would be the end of them or snitching just because Luthor did not involve them. Justice League is basically a form of law enforcement, yet we see no benefit that would bring. Lack of imagination on writers' part in my opinion.We finally get a competent villain. And while I like the double cross and the reasons for it, Joker is cranked up to eleven with his exact knowledge of what Luthor would do and his scientific and engineering and chemistry knowledge. Joker is great engineer, has some experience with poisons and science itself does not interest him. Even in this issue we are shown that he needs others to fine tune his grandiose plans and make sure his gas would not disipate between being released from balloon to descending on ground. He does not have expertise to design specific gas for each villain and make sure luthor is imune to all of them. He also despises letting others do bigger and badder things than he does, so him leaving Luthor to Freak-Who-Cackles feels really out of character for me. Which is a shame because as I said, I like his reasoning and intention to ruin the master plan just as it would be finishing.Neither villain is willing to face the fact the other is right. Joker always goes for a kill and Luthor always tries to be smarter than everyone and it got old long time ago. I like the fact that they are in character in the stubborn refusal to face the reality is what makes them villains, that Joker's murders are never going to have the effect he wants, Batman will not break and kill him because of it, and there will always be smarter people than Lex Luthor because no one knows everything and it takes time and effort to be expert in any given field.I do not like the art on Cheetah. It does not look all that bad, but... I don't know, looks more like an old lady than a humanoid feline.They kept Ivo's disfigurement. Nice. They are bringing back Brainiac. Bad. Very bad idea.

After discovering the doorknob at his dad's old Legion club, Luthor killed Vandal Savage and attempted to divert the earth's course away from the totality headed out from the Source Wall by breaking up the earth's crust. The JL thwarted that (by blowing up the moon?) and the totality landed. Superman and MM went in to investigate with Batman and Hawkgirl riding along, but they were hijacked by Luthor and Joker. Luthor had earlier put the Legion of Doom together to find the seven hidden energies and unlock the secret of the totality. To Luthor's dismay Hawkgirl reacted to the totality and a pattern emerged on her wings. She, MM and GL travelled to Thanagar Prime to find out more, but discovered that Shayera was holding the Martian Keep hostage in a machine that could create a facade of the Thanagar that had once been. Before she died, the Keep shared with J'onn a secret from his past that had apparently been wiped from his memory - the fact that he'd been abducted by humans as a child, who were researching how to make a human-Martian race for Perpetua (the goddess of the totality, creator of a universe before the current one.) Starman, a hero from the past with some connection to the Source Wall energy, discovered a way to use the remaining Omega Titans and Hawkgirl to repair the Source Wall.

14634,Batman-2016/Issue-24,"YES! I mean... YES!I may shout that a few more times. YES! YES! YES! This issue is awesome, story and art both.Even if Selina says no this was a perfect issue. YES! Bruce has some open talk, speaks about his inner turmoil and the fact he is not happy, which might be the first I saw him admit it and he speaks also about his motivation for being Batman. YES!I really like Claire here. She never spoke much before so I was not at all invested in her but this blew my brains out. Even visually, I liked her with long hair and although I prefer shorter hair on women I am attracted to it suited her. Yet she looks good with short hair here too. And having someone in DC universe have actual honest conversation about super-hero-ing and if it should be done before someone actually gets serious about it is something I waited for a long time. YES! Usually we get someone thrown into a deep end and they either have their illusions shattered and it hardens them or breaks them. Claire does not seem hardened nor broken here and I dig it.And all of that pales compared to that last page where the low key chase entwined with rest of the issue between Selina and Bruce suddenly overpowers rest of the issue at its finish. YES! I love it! I hope she says yes and they won't mess them up as they did in the end of Hush story line. And hopefully she won't be pregnant with someone else like they did with Helena Kyle pre-N52.10/10 for me.Edit: There is Powerless TV series billboard advertisement in the page where Selina Jumps out of her window.Edit 2: I just reread this series and in issue 3 Batman says to Gotham Girl's brother when he was a boy and Batman saved him and their parents from a mugger exactly the same thing Claire said to Bruce here. That it is OK to be scared and that it is a chance to be brave. Nice bit of continuity, that I forgot about. Issue 3 was a long time ago.",matejsojka,19.0,0.0,0.0,0.16,0.495,0.222,0.052,0.726,0.997

Remember what that is, Mr. Great Power? At this point I don't mind his friends treating him like shit; he clearly deserves it given the way he acts.Oh and of course Peter shows off how fucking naive he is. Again. When Clayton/Clash nearly causes the building (and the whole block) to blow up because a botched theft of a machine he stays behind to help stop it from killing all of them. And somehow in Spidey's eyes this justifies letting him go and not chasing him...uh, dude, if I pretty much set fire to a building I don't get brownie points for trying to put it out afterwards.I'm glad Harry pretty much told Peter to go fuck himself after this.

15355,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-700,I agree with you 100 percent. Superior Spider-Man was one of the worst Spider-Man events in history. It's right up there with One More Day and Sin's Past.,disqus_bvaJgFELO7,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.047,0.637,0.176,0.12,0.704,0.226
15356,The-Amazing-Spider-Man-1963/Issue-700,"I think Superior Spider-Man was overall pretty underwhelming. It started great, it was a very good idea, but it went south really fast mainly because of the way Otto was written and the way the story escalated to absurd levels really fast. I mean... when the comic ended Spider-Man was kind of an evil genious who had monitored the entirety of New York city, had his own army, his own mechas and an evil lair (and killed people), and no one ever seemed to care or think anything was wrong or different about him (not enough to confront him at least). It got so ridiculously over the top that it didn't work. But that doesn't make this plot twist any less effective or this particular issue any worse.This was a great 700th issue regardless of what happened next.And to everyone who thinks this ""destroyed Peter Parker"" somehow (who reading this comment section are apparently some people) I have this to say; No, it didn't. It didn't destroy anything. Just like Peter wasn't destroyed after OMD, or how he wasn't destroyed after the Ben Reilly affair in the 90's, or that one time he stopped being a radioactive hero and his origin was retold so he's the avatar of some spider-god or some shit like that (remember that? That's probably Spider-Man's biggest retcon and no one seems to go apeshit about it ever!). And it didn't simply because this is a character that has existed for 52 years. This is a character that has been written by more writers that anyone can name, who has been through more changes in his status quo that anybody can mention. And that's the whole point of comics, a writter comes and does whatever he/she wants with the character. Because, aside from the somewhat predefined personality (like you can't make a brooding, dark, edgy Peter Parker or an easy going jokester Batman -unless it doesn't last and the change has an explanation plotwise) there's nothing fixed. What happens to them, the adventures they live, their status quo... are kind of irrelevant. They're just background noise.This, like any other change in Spider-Man's history, made a number of changes, some lasted, some (most in this particular case) didn't. Just like any other time a writer (or the editors at Marvel) tried to do something ""new and original"" with the character. Because that's how comic books work. And sure, as fans we all will have nostalgia towards our favourite period of time of our favourite superhero character(s) but that doesn't mean they have to stay that way (whatever ""that way"" is) forever. If that was true then Peter would still be a teenager going to high school. And nobody really wants that.",disqus_zeEKpNxImG,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.117,0.574,0.12,0.125,0.756,-0.825

The build up really makes me feel like Peter is going to claim his life back and triumph as usual, but no. It really made you feel something, even if you knew Peter would come back eventually.The character development along this run from Ock was phenomenal, and I can't lie, the people who hated this story most likely hated it simply because they don't like Dan Slott and have a massive bias against him, as well as those who don't like change and always force marvel to bring stuff back to the way they were before.
