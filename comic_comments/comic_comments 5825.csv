They've fought too hard for Alexandria and the establishment of an economy between those communities just to see Rick &amp; gang up and relocate. If this were a Presidential race, I could see Rick's role being more like a campaign manager for Mercer. He expressed his real feelings about the Milton regime in the panel where he's laying the verbal smackdown on that shitbird Sebastian &amp; he's interacted with Mercer enough to see what kind of leader he would be. Purely speculation, but I can see Rick giving a speech or something of the sort to reason with the people, so Mercer can have the chance to address them while the Milton regime is in hiding. When they return, the power balance will have shifted toward the people / guards and, with Rick as the facilitator, the people will be given the chance to cast their vote for leader.

Of course, Pamela would be devastated, but I'm hoping she'll stay alive and grow as a character.

228,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-187,"The problem with characters like Sebastian is they only ""change"" for so long before the resort right back to their natural ways again. The reason Rick works so well as a main character is because his character has been honest from the start, he's never been something he wasn't ""before"" ... Michonne is another good example of what people end up resorting back ""into"" ... She was for a short time what she *needed* to be to get by until the Commonwealth offered her basically her old life back, and she grabbed onto it because deep down, she's been someone else, she ""changed"" for awhile, but we never saw her ""before"" persona ... We are now seeing it, and from the looks of it, a lot of people don't like this side of Michonne, but this is the REAL Michonne - I'm hoping she makes a choice and picks the persona we've all come to like, but this is the Walking Dead after all, nothing ever really goes how we'd like it too.So, yes, it'd be great if he ""came around"" and matured into a decent human being, but let's all be real, it wont last and he'll end up being a weak character.

Honestly people is just way too salty about politics, and I'm trying to be polite here, because everyone gets about socialism/communism and capitalism and shit when in the end, it's very simple, because a syou say, rebuilding society is about going form the basics. Rick just wants to avoid exploitation by directly not going to that phase, fair in my opinion.

320,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-185,"I don't think you get it. Rick and Michonne see the Commonwealth as the closest thing to society prior to the Walkers. They know that this place has its problems and said problems need to be fixed, but you don't throw away the baby with the bathwater. The problems don't need to be violently fixed with a revolution: they can be fixed through peaceful political means such as by leading by example, changing laws, establishing new precedents, and electing new representatives. Sure the Commonwealth is sorta a plutocracy at the moment, but with the right people and the right pushes it can become ideally what America was founded on (a republic for the greater good of the individual).Michonne caught herself and showed great remorse over her waitress-comment. She recognizes she has the potential to become a sociopath-elitist and she needs to keep herself in check better (thankfully her daughter will help her with that). Regarding the Commonwealth officers, they already got informally punished for it hence why the charges were pleaded to be dropped. Trust me, if they had a choice in the matter they probably would have preferred to serve a sentence rather than get the shit kicked out of them to the point they're clinging to their lives in the ICU. Making them serve a sentence after that would almost be like double-jeopardy as well as destabilize the military/police-force by making them feel their government doesn't have their back ever. This would further risk in achieving the Commonwealth's destruction - which is why Michonne defended them out of her principles.

Whatever that may come with, it's just that I want to hold out for classist people who might behave like that but because they don't know any better, so that if you have that behavior, it isn't necessarily just for being full of oneself, it's because one doesn't know better.

And whether he admits or is even aware of it, Rick's operated under the idea that he and his group are the last/best chance at rebuilding civilization. Ideally (for me) Commonwealth could have proven to him that there are people genuinely more qualified and better equipped than him to lead, a possibility that's been teased before, but a reality he's never actually faced.

They don't have similar experiences because the writer isn't creative, it's an intentional parallel between their lives thus far. The that they've both suffered and done terrible things to survive, and also done things in retaliation as well. The point is to show that they both get it, the things you can be pushed to do.

749,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-177,"Let me start by saying I dig the direction overall here. I know a conflict had to brew at some point, but I hope this isn't going to be the big one, but just a false start that gets resolved to show these people are alright, before something bigger rears its head. It's just that after thinking about it for a minute, why would they even need a coup? Mercer has all the military power and security. If he doesn't like how his men are being treated and used, with how people are specialized into jobs in this society, can't they just go on strike? No security til you stop treating us like shit and wasting us on meaningless jobs like babysitting? I doubt it would take long for people to give in.I guess it depends what kind of ""governer"" she is. Like if they've established term-lengths or anything like that. If she's just leading with the intent to lead til she dies, I can see that breeding resentment as it clearly has with Rick and Maggie multiple times. If they put a time limit and actually vote on new leaders periodically, then uprisings would be less likely as they could just wait it out til they can get voted in.In fact, I'm surprised we've only seen groups with singular leaders. I would think something like a leading council, a small group of people leading with equal vote and power that get cycled out periodically. I realize that's what was in the latest walking dead telltale game and it didn't work out for the best...but I feel like it'd work better if psychos and assholes weren't allowed on the council.

They can be enjoyed and appreciated for different, and the same reasons.AMC didn't make a perfect show, but Kirkman didn't write a perfect comic.

941,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-173,"I get what you're saying, but at the same time this is still a story and it's disappointing when a story arc like the Whisperers end in such a boring way. Imagine how lame it would be if Rick had just formed a blockade and waited for Negan and the Saviors to starve to death, or if the Governor had gotten sick and died. Obviously, those aren't exactly one to one comparisons to Beta, who still went out with a fight, but I still think that Kirkman could've chosen a better way to end Beta's story, that could still remain realistic. I mean, look at Game of Thrones, a story built on being as realistic as they can in a fictional world. A lot of characters in Game of Thrones don't die in a blaze of glory, but they are still good because they are done so well, and Beta's just isn't.

And not just them, but the remaining citizens of the Kingdom and the Hilltop as well (The Saviors will probably stay where they are and get whats coming to them).Based on how close the Walker Horde was to Alexandria (you can see the clock tower in the background of the panel), I believe the Survivors will have little time to gather their things before fleeing. This is important because Eugene will probably have to leave his CB radio behind.This all sets up a interesting scenario were once again Eugene is telling the group he is with about a supposed sanctuary that only he knows about. Assuming the survivors escape the Horde its only logical that Eugene will finally admit he has been in communication with someone from Ohio and that this person claims that her location is safe from Walkers.The issue becomes then, Will any of the Survivors, especially Rick who discovered Eugene's deception before, believe Eugene when he tells them about Ohio but has no way to prove it?",briantrachuk,4,0,0

1672,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-158,"I'm having kind of mixed feelings about this arc. Firstly I don't think the whisperer's war-strategy is actually that efficient as the comic wants to portray it. The fact they're not using guns (probably because of lack of guns) means their stabby-stabby ways don't differ that much from a regular zombie, and when you start thinking about it, it's kind of retarded to assume people would let any zombie to a stab distance just because ""it's zombie"". Sure, they were able to wreak havoc but that's not because they are a worthy opponent but apparently because the good guy militia was somewhat incompetent. A whisperer is pretty much just a shit upgrade from your average zombie and the fact the soldiers weren't able to repel them yet is kind of unbelievable.Second complain would be how I'm a bit disappointed in the direction the arc took. I was hoping the tension in the arc would be caused by a more complex set of moral and ethic dilemmas on the topic if it's ""just"" to declare a war on people because they have a differing culture. I really liked the fact for example rape-habits seemed in many occasions be the deal breaker and many people considered they had to re-educate the people to be ""civilized"" again, which even has many historical real world parallels. But apparently we're going at this with the old fashioned kill them all type of a way now, aren't we? I think it's kind of a downgrade in the storytelling department.",disqus_ZWu2l22Sgv,1,0,0

He could have fucked everybody over if nobody knew they were coming. This helping game doesn't make any sense if that's his endgoal. There is no amount of brownie points he can win where everybody'd be okay with him killing Rick. Heck, if the two wandered off together and Rick just had a heart attack or something, more than half the main cast would still be trying to kill him cause who'd believe that?

He was being honest before when he said he wanted to help. Rick convinced him back during that fight. Negan actually came around to realizing he was going about it flawed (he is by his own admission broken), making a small fiefdom of raiders when he should have built a unified empire. He understands that he can't be the one to build it, not now, not after everything. But Rick? Rick's doing it. He just is a little too far on the other end. Rick has the right idea an how it should all be but he won't go far enough to do it. Negan's gone way too far, but he can totally do the things Rick can't. Like slide up to this Alpha problem and solve it. Will there be a war? Yep. But there should be a war. These guys need to be put down, Negan just said as much. Better to get that done with now before they are larger and stronger some day. I could see him leading them into a deliberate fustercluck just to make sure they go down quick.

2909,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-121,"He did, but then the show decided to do what it always does and spin its wheels on the same point. Eugene had his moment with Abraham about manning up, then they made him backslide just so later he can man up again. It's the same thing with that Heapster arc. They push the same point over and over. Seem to be about to do it again with Oeanside as well. I think the showrunners just don't understand the characters. Maybe they don't read the comics closely or maybe they just don't take the time to really get to know who these people are. Maybe it's actual hubris where they constantly think they can add to something that's already fantastic. The thing is when they deviate from the source material it rarely even comes out better than the comics. I have trouble reading a lot of the comments on here, even.

Not only that, the story ark with Shane was SOOOOO much better than the comics, oh my goodness I can't even begin with that shit. Negan's introduction...way fucking better than the comics. (Hats off to Jeffery Dean mother fucking Morgan.) and another thing the show got better was Glenn and Maggie. But that is a personal thing for me. Also, Morgans character was way fucking better than the comic, and I think there will be a realistic reason for keeping him alive in the show.. (Morgan might die) :( But overall, I give the show 9/10 and the comic 7/10 Don't get me wrong, I love the comic and I think they did an excellent fucking job with it. But I think the show does a better job at explaining and showing how those things happened. I also know that Kirkman has admitted he regrets doing a lot of shit. I agree with him. Like, one thing that the comic really sucked ass on explaining was the Governor. I mean, the Governor just brought Rick in and for no reason said ""Okay, you don't understand me...choppy fucking choppy on Ricks hand."" I mean wtf I feel like it would have made more sense to take Ricks hand in all out war.. (Maybe it gets shot off or some shit.) Because we have Michonne to remind us of how fucked up he was, I mean come on, he used her katana to do some really fucked up shit.

That was it. Let's be honest with ourselves. I've been binge reading these comics all week and it's only taken me a couple of days to get to this point, and that's all Glenn was. Kirkman slid in the Maggie being pregnant thing at the last second to try to make Glenn's death more tragic.That's why I didn't even care when they killed Abraham in the comic. He was just muscle who screwed Rosita and then Holly. That was all he was. The show, he was fleshed out a little better and I at least thought ""well that sucked"" when they killed him off.There are some things the comic does better, like Woodbury and Andrea.

They have what's known as a gender tax, as in products only a woman would buy or women's versions of male products, are for the most part more expensive.

3947,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-79,"There's a gay couple in the comic, and you know why it's no big deal at all? Because his sexuality isn't the only thing about Aaron that the writer wants you to focus on. In Marvel Comics lately when they replace classic characters with a black/gay/Muslim/etc. character, those characters are 1-dimensional and their race or sexual orientation is the big focus of them that the writers and Marvel wants you to focus on. Like Miles Morales. They piggybacked him off the name and recognition of the Spider-man character, and he easily wins his fight, most of the time with literally one touch. Everyone instantly loves him and the only real conflict is all artificial. The same with Female Thor. Miles' race and Female Thor's gender is all the writers of those books want you to focus on. They don't want to write them to be more than that, they just want to pat themselves on the back for getting rid of ""CIS-white Male"" characters from the books.Aaron is gay, but that's not the defining thing about his character. He's a guy who goes outside the wall, along with his boyfriend, and they risk their lives to look for good people that they can offer sanctuary to. They saved the lives of Rick and his group by bringing them to Alexandria.That is the defining thing about Aaron, the kind of man he is. He's selfless and his main goal is to help good people get to safety. His resolve falters in this issue, but at least he has good reasons for why he thinks maybe they should stop looking for people.If characters are introduced that are gay or black or whatever, the writers of said comic need to stop making that the only thing you are to focus on. Marvel and DC are horrible about that. Aaron and Eric's characters are more than just their orientation, and that is why they are good characters.And is anyone else wishing that Abraham said ""Mother Dick"" in the comic like he did on the show?",averagejoe1987,32,1,0

Well, excuse me but after everything, having a safe place after such a long time in the open, everyone in Rick's position would've acted the same. And after being in danger for so long and losing his newborn child and wife, domestic abuse is perfectly understandable to make him go insane. People here are worried about what to cook and if the newly arrived would like it, Pete's beating his wife and child probably because he's a drunk and whatever, you get the point and no one is acting because everyone's a pussy.And you're telling me that he's not a good leader?

Unless they kill (TV Show) Judith off, the show just reminds me of a lame, toned down version of the comics. The comics were smart to kill Judith off, because, i'm not trying to sound prejudice against the young, nothing against the young in real life, but, babies, toddlers, and, small children (under 5) are an inconvenience for a show like The Walking Dead. Judith burned that bridge with me when she has her massive temper tantrum in the episode ""Inmates"", not only was her over-the-top crying ANNOYING, but, her tantrum put those two young girls in danger by attracting zombies. Judith has to die on The Walking Dead TV series, she serves no purpose, regardless of age for Judith. They could always kill Judith off-screen, even between episodes. They should of killed Judith off in the season 4 mid-season finale ""Too Far Gone"", it would of went great with the comics and it would of been off-screen, because, they showed an empty baby seat with blood on it.",disqus_zZCFoEe8hC,6,0,0

The fact that Rick woke up unharmed and made it to Atlanta is a miracle, he should be dead. Then there was a nationwide epidemic. Shane didn't have to but decided to make sure Lori and Carl made it out of their small town in one piece and brought them to Atlanta. I'm sure the whole experience was very traumatic for both of them. I think Lori was in a very stressful situation and sought comfort from a friend. I do not condone it but I certainly wouldn't fault her for it given the crazy circumstances. Why does everyone blame Lori and not Shane?

He cut Allen's leg off to try to save him. Allen died from that, but he was dead anyway with a walker bite. Rick took a chance to give Allen a chance. He killed Dexter, but that was after Dexter had pointed a gun at all of them, including the women and children, and threatened to kill them if they didn't leave right that second. Rick knew how they barely survived before they found the prison, so he did what was necessary to keep the group safe. Tyreese being against that is stupid after he just boasted about how good it had felt to kill Chris.They're also upset about Rick wanting to hang Thomas. Why? Were thy upset that Rick didn't let the heroic murderer of little girls walk free? And Rick wasn't even the one who killed him, Maggie was. So why is everyone upset with Rick for suggesting hanging Thomas after what he had done?Rick was the only one in this issue in the right.",averagejoe1987,26,0,0
5203,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-24,"Honestly, I agree with everything that Rick has done, but I 100% understand why everyone else in the prison is so upset about it. By doing what is best for everyone Rick has stumbled across two negative effects; the first being, from the perception of the group, he has too much power, and the second being inoder to do what's right he has had to give up his humanity, he has become 'the walking dead'.I don't think the rest of the group is ready to give up on hope yet, preserving their way of life is just as important as their individual survival. Rick no longer agrees, he now cares more for making it to the next day then about how he does it.",disqus_t7jtaWKop9,2,0,0
5204,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-24,"Agreed but to a point. The crux of Rick's mindset (at present) and the one that everyone's been getting into a twist over is that the world they knew is gone. The structures in place to keep order, obliterated. The thin veneer of culture that held fast the selfish impulses of the masses, torn apart.Hope is the thing that keeps all these people going but its the hope that the world they knew will someday return that keeps their minds shackled.And that, plus the stress of the existential threat of zombie-hood, is not helping matters. The bitterest pill to swallow is that their ideas of right and wrong (by virtue of their past lives) will kill them in a lawless land where anyone with a gun can become king... if only for a time.",disqus_rgOn08O5Ij,0,0,0

Then just expected Dexter to be okay with that, and then snuck shot him. Dexter threatened, Rick did it.

But people *are* hypocrites, even when they don't mean to be, even if they mean the best intentions, especially under stress.And given how much everyone (except the children, of course) have been knocking boots since the end of the world occurred, I'm not surprised that there'd be romantically-driven drama in the story.Tyreese is a good dude, but his girl's dead, he killed her murderer (twice), had a good thing going, and then got to feel like a champ by getting sucked off by another chick. Shit happens, stress and sex and murder do funny things to the mind, and there's nothing (beyond more killing, more sex, and thus more stress) to vent with.Again, shit happens.

5247,The-Walking-Dead/Issue-23,"I'm going to be honest, I'm totally with Tyrese in this one. Yes, he is a totall hypocrite, I'll admit to that, and he was wrong to accuse Rick of being a murder when he is just as guilty of the same crime, but Rick was wrong from the beggining.His logic that Tyrese is the reason that Carol tried to kill herself, though on the outside is correct, does not take into account that Carol would have had to have been suverly suffering inorder to do something like that. I mean, she had a daughter for Christ's sake, if she was ready to give her up over losing Tyrese then there had to have been much more going on outside of Tyrese's control.Obviously Tyrese was wrong to cheat on Carol, but if Rick wants to be a 'leader' he can't go around looking for fights, and that is exactly what he did. I think the issue was attempting to show the fragile minds of the group (namely that of Rick and Carol's, and Tyrese to some extent), but the pattern that I am starting to see is Rick becoming less concerned with the good of the group and more concerned with his own version of justice.Rick is like a vigilante, dealing out justice by his own codes in a way he sees fit. With each issue he takes more and more control over the group, and this fight between him and Tyrese was not about Tyrese's afair, but instead about him fighting back against the way Rick has begun to assume all power. And from that standpoint, I have to side with Tyrese, despite his hypocracy.",disqus_t7jtaWKop9,3,0,0
